^Nv FOREWORD 

This book is offered to Americans as a brief military his- 
tory of the war to VJ-day. It aims to tell the whole truth 
so far as it can be told now in limited space and from public 
jX'v sources. Care has been taken to make the text as accurate 
^* \ as possible, but errors are bound to occur in any attempt to 
cover such a vast subject. Readers are invited to call these 
to the attention of the Infantry Journal. Corrections will be 
made in later editions. While it is largely military, as any 
account of war is bound to be, the language is not technical. 
To know the causes and events of this war and the princi- 
ples for which we fought, according to General Marshall, 
"is an indispensable part of military training and merits the 
thoughtful consideration of every American soldier." The 
mission of making soldiers aware of the background of the 
conflict was assigned by order of the War Department, Feb- 
ruary 9, 1942, to the Army Orientation Course which every 
soldier takes as part of his basic training. For this course 
lectures were prepared and published since 1942; and in 
addition to documentary films and reprints of many books, 
i 5^a special volume, The War in Outline, was printed in several 
' "' editions, world war ii: a concise history is an entirely 
new book. Like its predecessors, however, it has been written 
exclusively from public sources. 

It is hoped that this book will prove useful to soldiers in 
the field and to citizens at home for both reading and ref- 
erence. All Americans will observe that as much attention 
is given to the contributions made by our Allies to winning 
the war as to the vital part taken by the United States. This 
book should help us to understand what actually happened, 
when and where and how, in the greatest war in history, and 
to see it all in better perspective.

WORLD WAR II 



PART ONE 
WAR COMES TO AMERICA 

1. JAPAN ATTACKS PEARL HARBOR 

-Japanese bombing planes disabled the United States Pa- 
cific Fleet as it lay in Pearl Harbor the morning of December 
7, 1941. In a surprise raid lasting two hours a force of 105 
bombers crippled the ships and destroyed most of the aircraft 
in the Hawaiian Islands. All but twenty of the enemy planes 
flew back to the six carriers which had brought them under 
cover of bad weather within striking range of the great Amer- 
ican naval base. In the smoke, fire^ and explosions at Pearl 
Harbor they left behind them a Japanese declaration of war 
on the United States. 

By this "unprovoked and dastardly attack," Japan won 
a major victory which her armed forces quickly exploited in 
the conquest of Southeast Asia, the Philippines, and other 
islands in the Pacific. Japan did not destroy American naval 
power at Pearl Harbor. The 86 ships which lay there ex- 
posed to attack were not even the entire Pacific Fleet. Two 
task forces with four aircraft carriers and other vessels es- 
caped because they were at sea. Eight battleships, the new 
North Carolina and Washington, each of 35,000 tons, and 
the Idaho, New Mexico, Mississippi, Texas, New York and 
Arkansas, were in the Atlantic, for the fleet formerly concen- 
trated in the Pacific had been divided in 1941 to guard 
against both Germany and Japan. Most of the ships sunk or 
damaged were back in service within the following year — 
except the 26-year-old battleship Arizona, which blew up 
when a bomb plunged down her smokestack and exploded 
the forward powder magazine. 

The disaster suffered at Pearl Harbor, although temporary 
in its consequences, was grave indeed. Irreparable was the 
loss of 2,343 American service men dead, 1,272 wounded, 
and 960 who were never found. Besides the Arizona, four 
other battleships, the Oklahoma, California, Nevada, and 

1 



West Virginia; three destroyers, the Shaw, Cassin, and 
Downes; the Utah, an old battleship converted into a target 
vessel; the minelayer, Oglala; and a large floating drydock — 
all these were "either sunk or damaged so severely that they 
would serve no military purposes" for a year to come. Also 
heavily damaged, but back at sea much earlier, were three 
battleships, the Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Tennessee; 
three cruisers, the Helena, Honolulu, and Raleigh; a sea- 
plane tender, the Curtiss; and a repair ship, the Vestal. 
Most of the 273 Army planes on Hickam and Wheeler fields 
were destroyed ; those which might have taken the air against 
the enemy were pinned to earth by damaged runways. Of the 
202 Navy planes, 150 were destroyed in the first few min- 
utes of the Japanese attack. Altogether 38 American planes 
flew into action against the enemy, but the chief defense of 
the naval vessels moored at Pearl Harbor was necessarily 
limited to antiaircraft fire. 

Had the Japanese known the extent of their victory, a 
fact which the American Government took care to conceal, 
they might have invaded the Hawaiian Islands or followed 
up their first blow with others, the results of which could 
not have been so quickly repaired. The United States Army 
and Navy reacted with haste to secure the defense not only 
of the exposed islands in the Pacific but of the whole West- 
ern Hemisphere. 

Within a week after Pearl Harbor, two divisions of in- 
fantry rushed by train to the Pacific Coast; aerial reinforce- 
ments flew to the Panama Canal; and detachments of Coast 
Artillery were sent as far as Chile to defend the western 
coast of South America. All the critical areas on the Atlantic 
and Pacific coasts of the United States were reinforced 
within ten days after Pearl Harbor. In the course of six 
weeks, 600,000 troops with all their equipment were moved 
by rail to defensive positions. 

In this race to man the continental defenses of America, 
outposts in the Atlantic and Pacific were not neglected. One 
American division embarked for Great Britain, arriving in 
Northern Ireland late in January 1942. Two fast convoys 
left San Francisco for Pearl Harbor during the first ten days 
of the war. Under radio silence, two transports with 4,500 

2 



troops, which had been en route from Hawaii to the Philip- 
pines at the time of Pearl Harbor, reached Brisbane, Aus- 
tralia, after fifteen days. The flow of men and supplies to 
the Southwest Pacific was so fast that by June 1942, the 
defense of this area was strengthened by 150,000 American 
ground troops, ready to hold Australia and New Zealand 
against Japan. 

As it happened, however, the Japanese were not interested 
in doing more than paralyzing American naval power. Their 
objectives lay not in the Central but in the South Pacific 
from Australia to India. The tactical success which they 
achieved by surprise at Pearl Harbor was also a strategical 
victory because it gave them freedom of action in the Far 
East. Their advantage did not last long, however, for in the 
Battle x)f the Coral Sea [May 7-8, 1942], six months later, 
the American Navy rallied to turn the Japanese back in the 
South Pacific; and a month later, in the Battle of Midway 
[June 3-6, 1942] to crush the enemy when he again pene- 
trated the Central Pacific. Pearl Harbor was the beginning, 
not the end, of the war for the United States. 



2. AMERICA SURPRISED 

The American people were astounded by the incredible 
news that Japan had bombed Pearl Harbor. What shocked 
them was the bold treachery of so unexpected an attack, and 
the fact that Japan rather than Germany had struck first. 
They were not astonished, however, to find themselves at 
war. A month before Pearl Harbor, according to polls of 
Arnerican public opinion, it was realized that sooner or later 
we must fight. Four out of five people thought armed con- 
flict with Germany inevitable; two out of three believed we 
could not escape war with Japan. Of every ten persons ques- 
tioned all over the country, seven said that it was more im- 
portant for us to defeat Germany than to stay out of war, 
and eight were confident that our Navy would destroy the 
Japanese Fleet. There were few perhaps who could imagine 
how or when war would reach America; most people ex- 

3 



pected that we should go to war rather than wait for it to 
come to us. 

When we were attacked at Pearl Harbor, all doubt of our 
foreign policy and its relation to National Defense vanished. 
The fact that we were compelled to fight in self-defense put 
an end to the long debate which had been carried on be- 
tween "isolationists" and "interventionists," as the two 
schools of opinion called each other; one holding that our 
safety was to be secured by the defense of only the Amer- 
icas, the other that it was threatened by the German con- 
quests in Europe and by the Japanese in Asia. After Pearl 
Harbor there could no longer be any question of remaining 
isolated from or intervening in a war which had come to our 
territorial shores. Fortunately for the American people, con- 
fronted by the strongest enemies in their history, the Jap- 
anese attack on Pearl Harbor united them more than ever 
before. Astonishment gave way quickly to anger, and anger 
froze in the grim determination to wage war until all en- 
emies were crushed. 

The day after Pearl Harbor [December 8, 1941] the 
United States Congress heard President Roosevelt declare 
that "we will not only defend ourselves to the uttermost, but 
we will make it very certain that this form of treachery will 
never again endanger us." The Congress voted, only one 
member dissenting, that a state of war existed between the 
United States and the Japanese Empire, and empowered the 
President as Commander in Chief of the armed forces under 
the Constitution to wage war with all the resources of the 
country. 

The next evening [December 9, 1941], two days after 
Pearl Harbor, President Roosevelt addressed his fellow- 
countrymen over the radio, warning them that Japan was 
not their only enemy: 

"The sudden criminal attacks perpetrated by the Japanese 
in the Pacific provide the climax of a decade of international 
immorality. Powerful and resourceful gangsters have banded 
together to make war upon the whole human race. Their 
challenge has now been flung at the United States of Amer- 
ica .. . The course that Japan has followed for the past 
ten years in Asia has paralleled the course of Hitler and 

4 



Mussolini in Europe and Africa. Today, it has become far 
more than a parallel. It is collaboration, actual collaboration, 
so well calculated that all the continents of the world, and 
all the oceans, are now considered by the Axis strategists as 
one gigantic battlefield." Referring to Pearl Harbor, he said, 
*'we must face the fact that modern warfare as conducted in 
the Nazi manner is a dirty business. We don't like it — vve 
didn't want to get in it — but we are in it and we're going to 
fight it with everything we've got." 

Our cause, he said, and the cause of millions of other 
people, was "liberty under God." 



3. GERMANY DECLARES WAR: THE AXIS AGAINST 

AMERICA 

Four days after Pearl Harbor [December 11, 1941] Ger- 
many and Italy declared war on the United States. The Tri- 
partite Pact [September 27, 1940] which had joined Rome, 
Berlin, and Tokyo in diplomatic alliance against the United 
States, became a full-fledged military alliance. By the terms 
of a new agreement, Italy, Germany, and Japan were now 
bound to "conduct in common and jointly a war" against 
the United States and England, and not to make peace sep- 
arately. "The Tripartite Pact," shouted Mussolini to the 
crowds gathered in Rome, "becomes a military alliance which 
draws around its colors two hundred and fifty million men 
determined to do all in order to win." "A historic revenge," 
Hitler told the Reichstag, "has been entrusted to us by the 
Creator, and we are now obliged to carry it out." 

It was evident that the Axis Powers had a joint plan for 
sharing the spoils of a Fascist world to be won by war on 
two fronts against the United States. The American Congress, 
without a dissenting vote, immediately recognized that a 
state of war existed between this country and Germany and 
Italy. An article in the Selective Service Act prohibiting the 
use of American armed forces beyond the Western Hemis- 
phere was rescinded. Having tried and failed to defend itself 
in its own territories and waters, the United States was at 
last compelled to defend itself everywhere in the world. 

5 



"We are now in the midst of a war [said President Roose- 
velt] not for conquest, not for vengeance, but for a world in 
which this nation, and all that this nation represents, will be 
safe for our children. We expect to eliminate the danger from 
Japan, but it would serve us ill if we accomplished that and 
found the rest of the world was dominated by Hitler and 
Mussolini. So, we are going to win the war and we are going 
to win the peace that follows." 



4. JAPANESE AGGRESSION IN ASIA 

The military reason why Japan struck at Pearl Harbor, 
as indicated above, was to neutralize the American Navy in 
the Pacific so that it could not interfere with Japanese 
troops overrunning Southeast Asia. The political reason why 
Japan dared to go to war with both the United States and 
Great Britain was that these nations opposed Japanese ex- 
pansion in Asia and helped China to resist it. The course of 
events which led directly to Pearl Harbor covers ten previous 
years, from 1931 to 1941 — ten years of mihtary aggression 
and conquest by Japan on the Asiatic mainland at the ex- 
pense first of China and then of France. So it might be truly 
said that this war first broke out, not in Europe when Ger- 
many attacked Poland in 1939, but in Asia when Japan be- 
gan to encroach on China in 1931. There was never a dec- 
laration of war, but it was war, limited to the north until 
1937, then spreading south along the Chinese coast up to 
1941, and finally sweeping out over the Pacific and South- 
east Asia. 

The Japanese Army took the warpath in 1931 when it in- 
vaded and occupied the Chinese territory of Manchuria. The 
excuse for this action was the so-called "Mukden Incident" 
[September 18, 1931]. Japan claimed but never proved that 
Chinese bandits blew up a section of the South Manchurian 
Railway, owned by the Japanese and heavily guarded by 
their troops. It was obviously by careful planning long in 
advance that the Japanese forces, massed in Korea, were 
able to seize not only Mukden, the capital city, but all the 
strategic points in Manchuria. By invading and occupying 

6 



this region, Japan came into control of rich economic re- 
sources, which properly belonged to China. Manchuria was 
reorganized as ^lanchukuo [February 18, 1932], nominally 
an independent state but actually a puppet of Tokyo, with 
all its resources exploited for the increase of Japanese armed 
strength and power. 

Chinese Nationalists, growing more united in the face of 
a common enemy, struck back at Japan with the best weapon 
they had, an economic boycott which deprived Japanese tex- 
tile factories in Shanghai of a large market for their goods. 
There was disorder in the. city and some Japanese were 
mobbed. Punishment was swift and severe. By land, sea. and 
air the Japanese attacked the native Chapei district [Janu- 
ary 29, 1932], where a Chinese army was stationed. Thou- 
sands of civilians were killed. But the stubborn resistance of 
the Chinese Nineteenth Route Army, containing an am- 
phibious assault for several weeks, prevented the Japanese 
from breaking the boycott of their goods or conquering 
Shanghai. 

Japan next attacked the northern provinces below the 
Great Wall, territory which had always been Chinese. The 
Kwangtung Army, a Japanese force garrisoned in Manchuria, 
crossed the Great Wall and moved south on Peiping and 
Tientsin during April and May, 1933. Lacking both the 
power and the will to resist alone, the Chinese agreed to a 
truce at Tangku [May 31, 1933], which lost them control of 
the province of Jehol, adjoining Manchuria, and exposed 
other provinces to Japanese influence and infiltration. In 
1935, Japan struck again, and this time she did not stop 
until she was supreme in the five northern provinces of 
Chahar, Suiyuan, Ningsia, Shansi, and Hopeh. Yet China 
was too vast a country to be subdued by these limited cam- 
paigns. Welded together by the relentless pressure of Japan, 
the Chinese people became stronger in resisting every attack. 

In 1937 Japan intensified her effort to conquer China, 
claiming as provocation what the Japanese called the ''China 
Incident [July 7, 1937], an alleged attack by Chinese sol- 
diers at the Marco Polo Bridge in Peiping. The real cause 
of the struggle was always the adamant refusal of Chiang 
Kai-shek and the people of China to become Japanese i">\ip- 

7 



pets like Manchukuo or to be the victims of an economic 
monopoly which Japan called the "Greater East Asia Co- 
Prosperity Sphere." Chinese resistance led to a long war of 
attrition which has taken the lives of five to ten million 
Chinese and of nearly one million Japanese in the past seven 
years. Some forty million Chinese have fled the coastal 
provinces conquered by Japan, and in a great westward mi- 
gration to the interior of their vast country they have built 
up an agrarian society which the Japanese have not been 
able to conquer. For the Japanese Army the China War has 
been a training ground and field of maneuvers, the results of 
which were to be seen, together with new weapons like the 
Zero fighter plane and new tactics like jungle infiltration, in 
Southeast Asia after Pearl Harbor. 

The Japanese won quick victories in China, but none was 
decisive. They occupied the old capital of Peiping [July 29, 
1937] and the next day, Tientsin. After a siege of three 
months they took the great seaport of Shanghai [November 
8, 1937]. As Chiang's army withdrew westward, the Japa- 
nese pursued them and captured the Nationalist capital of 
Nanking [December 13, 1937], inflicting barbarous atroci- 
ties on the civilian population as part of a new policy of 
terror. An incomplete Japanese blockade began to cut China's 
trade with the rest of the world and to drive European and 
American interests out of China. 

In 1938 the Japanese marched southwest against the rail 
center of Hankow, six hundred miles inland from Shanghai 
and key to the Yangtze River valley, but they were covered 
by Chinese troops to the northeast at Suchow. In the course 
of this campaign the Chinese defeated the enemy at Taierch- 
wang, but in October finally lost both Suchow and Hankow. 
On the southeastern coast the Japanese also captured the 
port of Canton [October 21, 1938], crippling the British 
port of Hong Kong. Chiang removed his government and 
army to Chungking, eight hundred miles up the Yangtze 
from Hankow, where narrow mountain gorges protected his 
inland-domain. 

With the outbreak of war in Europe [September 3, 1939], 
the Japanese gave up their attempt to destroy the Chinese 
armies and adopted a policy of limited warfare and block- 

8 



ade. They seized the coastal ports of Swatow, Ningpo, and 
Foochow in 1939, effectively cutting China off from any 
foreign aid except the small amount which came in over the 
Burma Road. As the German armies swept over Europe in 
1939 and 1940, Japan consolidated her position in northern 
China and along the coast while preparing to overrun South- 
east Asia. 

By the time she struck at Pearl Harbor, after four years 
of sporadic fighting in China, Japan had occupied the largest 
cities — Shanghai, Peiping, Tientsin, Hankow, and Canton — 
and ten provinces in the fertile plains of the lower Yangtze 
and Yellow rivers. Chiang Kai-shek controlled only the five 
provinces of Szechwan, Shensi, Kansu, Kweichow, and Yiin- 
nan, and important parts of Kwangsi and Shensi. Japan 
dominated about one-quarter of the entire area of China 
and ruled almost half its population. Three strategic keys 
Japan did not hold, and without them no conqueror has ever 
subdued China: Shensi, where the mountains command the 
North China plain; its barrier, the great elbow of the Yel- 
low River at Tungkwan, gateway to the rich interior of 
Shensi and Szechwan; and the Han River valley, which the 
Japanese had four times tried in vain to take. 

Japan made the mistake of attempting to conquer China 
cheaply, with as few men as possible, never using enough to 
destroy the Chinese armies or to occupy all the country. 
The largest army Japan had in China probably consisted of 
250,000 troops under General Terauchi in the initial cam- 
paign of 1937. Many more troops were eventually stationed 
in China to guard Japanese lines of communication and 
supply. The vast country swallowed up the men of Nippon 
wherever they went, and all they really conquered were the 
railroads and ports. Even in the provinces which they occu- 
pied, the Japanese were plagued by Chinese guerrillas, who 
fell upon their supply trains and garrisons with extraordinary 
success. The Japanese won battles but failed to conquer 
China. All they could do was to garrison the coastal ports, 
shutting China off from her friends, and fight to hold the few 
railroads and rivers leading into the remote interior. China, 
like Russia and the United States, is a country of continental 
size in which distance helps defeat the invader.

S. THE UNITED STATES OPPOSES JAPAN 

In the ten years before Pearl Harbor, Japan had grossly 
violated treaties which she had made with other nations, in- 
cluding the United States. At the Washington Conference 
of 1922, following the First World War, all nations with in- 
terests and possessions in Asia or the Pacific Ocean had 
reached these agreements in an effort to stabilize and assure 
the peace of the Far East. In the Four Power Pact [Decem- 
ber 13, 1921], Japan, Great Britain, France, and the United 
States promised to respect the island possessions which each 
had in the Pacific and not to extend their fortifications. This 
treaty Japan violated when she secretly built naval installa- 
tions in the Marianas and Carolines and when, after the fall 
of France in 1940, her troops penetrated French Indo-China 
and seized Hainan and the Spratly Islands opposite the 
Philippines. The most important agreement concluded at 
Washington in 1922 was the Nine Power Treaty [February 
6, 1922], in which all the Pacific Powers, including Japan, 
pledged themselves to respect the territorial integrity and ad- 
ministrative independence of China, and to keep an "Open 
Door" in China for the equal opportunity of all nations to 
trade there without monopolies, special privileges, or dis- 
criminatory tariffs. Japan broke this treaty by taking from 
China first Manchuria, then the Northern Provinces, and 
finally the eastern coast, and gradually closing the door to 
the trade of other nations in these regions. Finally, in re- 
sorting to force against China, Japan also violated the Pact 
of Paris, often called the Kellogg Pact, which almost all the 
nations of the world signed [August 27, 1928], agreeing to 
settle disputes by peaceful methods and to renounce war as 
an instrument of national policy. 

The United States protested each time Japan ignored the 
pledges made in these three treaties. It tried to apply brakes 
to Japanese expansion in Asia at the expense of China. A 
strong China, independent and united, had always been the 
primary object of American policy in the Far East, because 
if other nations divided China, whether by annexations or by 
establishing spheres of influence, their imperial rivalries 
would lead to war. Since it was to the interest of every 

10 



American to live in a world at peace, the United States sought 
to preserve peace in the Far East. And there could be no 
better guarantee of peace, from the point of view of Ameri- 
cans, than to prevent any nation from attaining complete 
supremacy in either Asia or Europe. 

This policy did not mean, however, that the United States 
was unalterably opposed to any change in Asia, but rather 
to arbitrary changes such as Japan made by force. In the 
past the United States had consented to a considerable in- 
crease of Japanese territory and power. When Japan annexed 
the Bonin Islands in 1876, Formosa and the Pescadores Is- 
lands in 1895 after a war with China, Korea in 1910, and the 
Marianas, Caroline, and Marshall Islands taken from Ger- 
many in the First World War, the United States had offered 
no objection. In all these years our Government never made 
any attempt to confine the Japanese people to their home 
islands. So far as the United States was concerned, Japan 
was free to grow and expand, but not by forcibly carving up 
China in utter disregard of all treaties made to keep the 
Far East at peace. 

When, therefore, Japan occupied Chinese Manchuria in 
1931, the American Secretary of State, Henry L. Stimson, re- 
fused to recognize such a change because it was accomplished 
by force in violation of both the Nine Power Treaty and the 
Kellogg Pact. His policy became known as the Stimson Doc- 
trine of Non-Recognition. It was the stand taken by the 
United States toward most of the later conquests and annexa- 
tions of territory which the Fascist nations achieved by mili- 
tary action. Japan was the first to expand by force, and since 
nothing was done to stop her, Italy and Germany realized 
that they could probably extend their empires in Africa and 
Europe with equal impunity. Hence the Manchurian crisis 
was the test of whether the march of Fascism could be halted 
short of war. 

In 1931, however, the American people were neither will- 
ing nor prepared to curb Japanese aggression at the risk of 
war. Like all the peoples of Western Europe they were sunk 
in the depths of an economic depression, and consequently 
domestic problems of bread and butter weighed more heavily 
on their minds than the international question of keeping 

11 



the peace and helping to police the world. Japan, and later 
the other Fascist nations, took advantage not only of the 
preoccupation of each nation with its own economic prob- 
lems but also of their failure to unite against aggression. 
The League of Nations, at the request of China, investigated 
the trouble in Manchuria and criticized Japan mildly in the 
Lytton Report, submitted in September 1932. The United 
States, although not a member of the League, cooperated in 
this investigation. Nevertheless, nothing was done, either by 
the League or by the United States, to compel Japan to 
change its course, observe treaties, consult with other na- 
tions, and expand only with their consent. When the small 
nations represented in the Assembly of the League passed a 
resolution condemning Japan and asking for the restoration 
of Chinese sovereignty in Manchuria [February 24, 1933], 
Japan withdrew from the League of Nations. 

The Japanese did not pursue their policy of expansion 
alone. In an Anti-Comintern Pact [November 25, 1936] 
signed with Germany the two nations struck an alliance, 
ostensibly against the Communist International of Soviet 
Russia but actually against any nation which chose to resist 
their own expansion. Henceforth, like the two ends on a 
football team, Japan and Germany took turns in running 
around all opposition in Asia and Europe. Japan no longer 
disguised her ambition to dominate China, except by the 
fiction that the collaboration of both countries would be to 
their mutual benefit in the creation of a New Order in East 
Asia. Since "the epidemic of world lawlessness [was] spread- 
ing" with the use of force, President Roosevelt suggested in 
a speech at Chicago [October 5, 1937] that nations which 
were waging war should be quarantined by nations which 
desired to keep the peace. To this bold suggestion there was 
little response from either the American people or other na- 
tions. While Japan was fighting in China to obtain what it 
wanted, other nations were not ready to run the risk of war 
for the sake of peace. 

Indeed, the fundamental policy of the United States 
throughout these troubled years was to stay clear of the dis- 
turbance and to preserve peace for itself. When the American 
gunboat Panay, on international patrol in China, moved up 

12 



the Yangtze River to relieve foreigners caught in the besieged 
city of Nanking, it was bombed and sunk by Japanese planes 
[December 12, 1937] . Japan immediately apologized and 
paid indemnities of two million dollars. The American people 
were chiefly disturbed because American lives and property 
had been exposed to hostile action. According to a poll of 
public opinion, in January 1938, seventy per cent of the 
people thought that all American forces should be withdrawn 
from China. 

This was, however, the high tide of sentiment in favor of 
the United States' isolating itself from the rest of the world. 
As the war went on in China, the increasing Japanese bru- 
tality caused American public opinion to harden. It became 
evident that Japan and Germany would not halt their ex- 
pansion if other nations did nothing to stop them. People 
awoke to the contradiction in our policy of protesting every 
act of Japanese aggression on the one hand, and on the other 
supplying Japan with the raw materials to make war. It was 
estimated that Japan imported nine-tenths of its scrap iron 
and copper, two-thirds of its oil, and a great deal of its avia- 
tion equipment from private sources in the United States. 
With growing public support for applying economic pressure 
to Japan, the American Government served notice [July 26, 
1939] that the commercial treaty of 1911 would be abro- 
gated. On the same day, when Congress granted the President 
authority, he put the export of oil and scrap iron under 
Government license and banned the shipment of aviation 
gasoline to Japan. 

The economic support which the United States withdrew 
from Japan was extended on a growing scale to China. 
Credits first granted in 1933 and 1934 were renewed in 1938 
for $25,000,000 and, with additional loans, reached a total 
of $170,000,000 by the end of 1940. Small as this aid was, 
it helped China to sustain its resistance to Japan. The Japa- 
nese countered American aid to China by entering a triple 
alliance with Germany and Italy [September 27, 1940], 
which pledged these countries to come to Japan's support if 
she were attacked. 

As Germany overran Western Europe in 1940, conquering 
Holland and France and threatening England Japan pre- 

13 



pared to move south from China to drive these nations out 
of their Asiatic colonies. The Japanese spoke no longer of a 
New Order in East Asia, limited to China, but of a "Greater 
East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" which would include French 
Indo-China, British Malaya and Burma, the Netherlands 
East Indies, and the Philippines. Foreign Minister Matsuoka 
declared that the "white race much cede Oceania to the 
Asiatics" [February 25, 1941]. To obtain freedom of action 
in Southeast Asia, Japan protected her rear, menaced by 
planes in Russian Siberia, by signing a pact of neutrality 
with Russia [April 13, 1941]. 

Then Japan applied increasing pressure to the French and 
Dutch colonies in Southeast Asia which had been orphaned 
by the German conquest of their mother contries. Bellicose 
demands were made on the Netherlands East Indies to sell 
Japan all their oil. But the United States, afraid lest the war 
should spread into the Pacific, took the pressure off the Dutch 
by continuing to supply the Japanese with petroleum prod- 
ucts. Meanwhile, in the summer of 1940, Japanese troops 
entered French Indo-China and, with the acquiescence of 
the weak Vichy French Government, transformed this stra- 
tegic region into a Japanese protectorate a year later. 

In the face of this direct threat to the Philippines and 
Southeast Asia, which were outflanked by Japanese forces 
in Indo-China, the United States took all possible steps short 
of war to halt Japan. The assets with which she did business 
in the United States were frozen [July 25, 1941] ; all her 
ships were barred from the Panama Canal; and the export 
of petroleum was severely restricted. Strategic raw mate- 
rials were purchased from Latin America in order to prevent 
Japan from getting them. As a result of all these economic 
restrictions, Japanese war industries slowed down. Their steel 
production, for example, declined to the level of 1936, their 
copper supply was cut in half, and altogether about three- 
quarters of their vital American imports were cut off. 

Japan appeared ready to compromise with the United 
States under this stringent economic pressure, but her diplo- 
matic advances did not mean much. As far back as 1935, 
Saburo Kurusu of the Japanese Foreign Office told an Amer- 
ican diplomat privately [December 22, 1935] that "Japan 

14 



. . . would in course of time be the 'boss' of a group com- 
prising China, India, the Netherlands East Indies, etc.," and 
that Japan's signing of "treaties for collective security," such 
as the Kellogg-Briand Pact, was ''hypocritical" [September 
12, 1940] . As Ambassador Grew said of Japan later in a tele- 
gram from Tokyo, ''the uses of diplomacy are bankrupt in 
dealing with such powers." Nevertheless, her Ambassador 
in Washington, Admiral Kichisaburo Nomura, began a long 
series of diplomatic talks with our Secretary of State, Cor- 
dell Hull, and was joined in November 1941, by a special 
envoy from Japan, Saburo Kurusu, the diplomat who had 
signed the Japanese alliance with Germany and Italy. In the 
light of what happened a month later, however, it was ob- 
vious that all these talks were but a diplomatic delaying 
action to screen Japanese preparations for the attack on 
Pearl Harbor. 

The United States and Japan, were unable to reach any 
compromise. The Japanese suggested in August 1941, that 
they would withdraw from French Indo-China if the United 
States would persuade China to accept peace terms agree- 
able to Japan. Secretary Hull refused to be a party to this 
dishonorable scheme. Finally, in November 1941, Japan sub- 
mitted her final demands for peace: she would not advance 
south beyond Indo-China if the United States abandoned 
China to its fate, resumed trade with Japan, especially in oil, 
and helped her [A^ovember 26, 1941] obtain other raw ma- 
terials. Secretary Hull's reply was a restatement of the con- 
ditions which the United States had always believed neces- 
sary to assure peace in the Far East: commercial relations 
would be resumed with Japan if she withdrew all her forces 
from both China and French Indo-China, joined in a non- 
aggression treaty to be signed by all the nations interested 
in the Pacific, and together with the United States abandoned 
all extraterritorial rights or claims in China. In other words, 
the United States promised Japan economic cooperation if 
she would withdraw from China and stop using force in the 
Far East. 

The Japanese reply was delivered at Pearl Harbor. Twenty 
minutes after bombs began to fall on the American ships 
stationed there, the Japanese envoys in Washington called 

IS 



upon Secretary Hull to tell him, not that war had begun but 
that negotiations were at an end, Reading the Japanese note, 
which alleged that the United States had opposed every at- 
tempt of Japan to bring "peace" to the Far East, Secretary 
Hull declared: 

"In all my fifty years of public service I have never seen 
a document that was more crowded with infamous false- 
hoods and distortions — on a scale so huge that I never imag- 
ined until today that any Government on this planet was 
capable of uttering them."

PART TWO 

ORIGINS OF THE SECOND 
WORLD WAR 



Americans who fought in Africa, Asia, Europe, and the 
Pacific knew that the war was a world war. It began long 
before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. All great na- 
tions and most small nations became involved. After the 
First World War treaties of peace were signed, armies were 
demobilized, navies were limited, and the reconstruction of 
devastated lands was undertaken. Multitudes of people be- 
lieved, or at least hoped, that wars were at an end. Now it 
is clear that the "peace" of Paris was only a truce, that the 
twenty years between wars were not really years of peace but 
years of unrest and of preparation for the new struggle. 

Why men and nations fight is not our subject. Our task is 
to tell how the apparent peace of 1919 became open war. 
The questions which must be asked are general, dealing with 
problems too complex and too recent for easy or final solu- 
tion. Many years must pass before the complete records of 
governments, statesmen, and generals, on both sides of the 
battle lines, will be available, before events can be seen in 
perspective and studied without prejudice. Yet what is hap- 
pening today can be understood only in the light of what 
happened yesterday, so we must make what use we can of 
that part of the record which we now have. Though our 
knowledge is anything but complete, we nevertheless have 
to offer answers to the problems of today. These answers 
are general, relatively simple, and above all, tentative. 

In the most general terms, the nations of the world were 
fighting to settle the differences which some were unwilling 
or unable to settle by peaceful means. It is possible to out- 
line the sequence of events, from smaller frictions and resent- 
ments to larger disagreements, then to isolated acts of vio- 
lence, and finally to open war. Our incomplete knowledge 

17 



and limited space do not permit a full and final account of 
events. We can tell here only the major causes of conflict 
and their stubborn growth until they led to a world at war. 



6. WHY THE LAST WAR DID NOT END WAR 

Our fathers fought Germany in the last war with high 
hopes, to which President Woodrow Wilson gave voice, that 
they were fighting to end all war and to make the world safe 
for Democracy. They defeated Germany but were disap- 
pointed in their hopes; we often say that they won the war 
but lost the peace. So deep was our disillusion that we hardly 
dared expect as much as our fathers. In fact, we seemed to 
mistrust their ideals and to look upon the war, in the words 
of President Roosevelt, as a "war of survival." Yet it has 
always been the faith of many Americans that the world 
could get rid of war and that a world of democratic nations 
would be a world at peace. They have been confirmed in this 
faith by their nation's experience, for Democracy works com- 
paratively well in the United States; ever since the Civil War 
all the states of the Union have settled their disputes in 
peace. But Europe is not America, and a system which ore 
nation has worked out slowly and sometimes painfully in the 
course of nearly two hundred years cannot suddenly be bor- 
rowed and operated successfully by other nations, especially 
when they have only begun to recover from an exhausting 
war. 

The victors of the First World War wanted Democracy 
to flourish in Europe, but their first aim in writing the Treaty 
of Versailles was naturally to provide for their own imme- 
diate security. For this reason the United States, Great Bri- 
tain, France, Italy, and Japan reduced the power of their 
chief enemy, Germany. She was disarmed, except for a 
force of 100,000 men; she lost her navy, her entire colonial 
empire, and about one-eighth of her territory in Europe. The 
Allies held Germany responsible for starting the war and for 
immense damage to Allied property. They charged her, there- 
fore, with reparations amounting to thirty-three billion dol- 
lars, a bill which was later progressively reduced but on 

18 



which Germany never paid even as much as she borrowed 
from private banks in the United States. The terms of this 
peace were accepted under protest in June 1919, by a repub- 
lican Germany which had overthrown the Hohenzollern mon- 
archy of the Kaiser. The weakness of such a peace became 
apparent in its aftermath: the German people, beaten but 
not crushed, nursed a sense of grievance which was later ex- 
ploited by Hitler. When he sought to evade and finally to 
undo the restrictions of the Treaty of Versailles, the former 
Allies of 1919 were unable or unwilling to enforce its terms 
by united military action. 

Postwar German Democracy was born of military defeat 
and grew up, a friendless orphan, under the burdens imposed 
by the victors. In the early years, when the German Republic 
might have been strengthened by the cooperation of its for- 
mer enemies, it received little international support. In 1923, 
for example, the French occupied the industrial Ruhr in a 
vain attempt to enforce the payment of reparations. From 
the beginning the German Republic lacked internal stability. 
The Prussian generals and land owners, a professional mili- 
tary caste, retained much power. Under their direction, every 
private in Germany's force of 100,000 was trained to be- 
come an officer of a larger future army necessary for a war 
of revenc;e. A disastrous inflation of the currency in 1923 
almost wiped out the middle class and multiplied the number 
of discontented people who were ready to listen to Hitler 
when he preached aggressive nationalism as a cure for both 
foreign avd domestic troubles. Germany, shorn of consider- 
able power after the last war, was provoked by discontent 
at home to struggle again for compensation abroad. 

The victorious Allies of 1919, having weakened Germany 
in the hope of making themselves secure, tried to organize 
peace in Europe on the basis of many small new states. The 
peacemakers believed, with President Wilson, that the best 
way to curb aggressive nationalism, which had plagued Eu- 
rope over a century, was to give each people which consid- 
ered itself a nation the right to self-government. In pursuit 
of this ideal of self-determination, they carved Finland, Esto- 
nia, Latvia, and Lithuania out of the old Russian Empire; 
put Poland together again from territory which Germany; 

19 



Austria, and Russia had taken; and split up the empire of 
Austria-Hungary, which had fought in aUiahce with Ger- 
many, into the independent states of Austria, Hungary, 
Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia. But the peoples of Europe, 
especially of central and eastern Europe, could not be di- 
vided along racial, linguistic, or national lines; in many 
geographic areas different peoples had been living for cen- 
turies side by side in the same towns and villages. Their na- 
tional ambitions, sharpened by historic feuds, were not to be 
settled by increasing the number of nations. Even though 
some of the new states might contain only one nationality 
and might govern themselves in greater harmony than the 
empire they replaced, they were relatively small and inca- 
pable of self-defense against the larger nations. It was ex- 
pected that France and the small countries would cooperate 
in holding Germany and a revolutionary Russia in check. 
When French power waned, however, all were at the mercy 
of their larger neighbors: Germany absorbed Austria and 
annexed Czechoslovakia; and Poland, which played Ger- 
many off against Russia, was eventually squeezed out of ex- 
istence. 

The survival of small nations actually depended upon a 
League of Nations, proposed by President Wilson, its prin- 
cipal architect, to allay the rivalry of the great powers and 
provide peaceful means for solving all disputes between na- 
tions. Economic and military sanctions, voted by the League, 
were to be used against any country which broke the peace. 
But the League was not a super-state; it reflected the dis- 
tribution of power prevailing among its members and^ ex- 
pressed the will of the strongest. Thus, in defiance of the 
League, Poland seized Vilna from Lithuania in 1920, and 
Italy bombed the Greek Island of Corfu in 1923. Although 
every state, strong or weak, was entitled to a voice in the 
Assembly, nothing important could be done without the as- 
sent of the Council, composed of the larger nations which 
had won the war. 

The larger nations could not always agree. Italy, dissat- 
isfied with the territorial settlement, left the peace confer- 
ence and gradually swung over to the side of the defeated 

20 



nations. Britain and France failed to see eye to eye on the 
severity with which Germany should be treated, France be- 
ing anxious to keep her old enemy weak, and Britain pre- 
ferring to restore German economic strength and to main- 
tain a balance of power in the European continent. 

The League was handicapped not only by the power poli- 
tics of its members but by the fact that it never included 
all the nations. The United States refused to join; Germany 
was not admitted until 1926; and by the time Soviet Russia 
was allowed to join the League in 1934, Japan, Italy, and 
Germany had begun to withdraw. The great powers of the 
world preferred to go their own way rather than to settle 
disputes and enforce peace through the League of Nations. 



7. NAVAL DISARMAMENT AND JAPANESE 
MILITARISM 

Disarmament was one of President Wilson's Fourteen 
Points for establishing a just and lasting peace. Germany 
was partially disarmed, and the Treaty of Versailles assumed 
that the other nations would reduce their armaments. The 
weapons of war were thought to be a principal cause of war 
and not simply the means of waging it. Taxpayers every- 
where, especially in the United States, resented the financial 
burden of building and maintaining fleets end armies. 

The United States took the lead among nations in moving 
toward disarmament. It called a conference of the chief naval 
powers, whose representatives met at Washington in 1921-22 
together with delegates from all countries with possessions 
in Asia and the Pacific. The reason they met was that naval 
disarmament could not be considered apart from the situa- 
tion in the Far East, for there the potential rivalry of Japan, 
Great Britain, and the United States might lead to naval war. 
The United States was in a fortunate position, because it 
had built up its navy during the last war to a strength that 
approached those of the British and Japanese; and it had 
the economic resources to outbuild either of these nations 
if they would not agree to some limitation of ships. The 

21 



British had no quarrel with us and recognized that we were 
entitled to a battle fleet equal to their own. The Japanese, 
although ambitious to extend their power in China, were 
governed at this time by Liberals who stood ready to co- 
operate with the nations of the West. 

Important treaties were signed at the Washington Con- 
ference for the joint purposes of limiting naval strength and 
assuring peace in the Pacific and Far East. Great Britain and 
the United States agreed to keep their navies equal, and 
Japan accepted a fleet inferior to both in the ratio of 5:3. 
France accepted a ratio of 1.75. No nation was to build any 
battleships for ten years. Japan, the United States, and Great 
Britain gave pledges not to strengthen their Pacific islands 
and bases. All these limitations proved to be a victory for 
Japan: although she had fewer capital ships, the nations 
which might oppose Japan were restrained at a time when 
they could easily have outbuilt her; and with the ban on the 
fortification of British and American bases in the Far East, 
Japan's smaller battle fleet, based on home ports, came into 
control of Far Eastern waters. 

The leading naval powers were able to call a halt to their 
rivalry because the situation in the Pacific, where they all 
had interests, was stabilized by two treaties. The Anglo- 
Japanese Alliance was abandoned. This was followed by a 
Four-Power Pact under which those countries, together with 
the United States and France, agreed to respect one another's 
island possessions and to consult in case of trouble. This 
agreement was a recognition of Japanese rights, without de- 
fining them, in the German islands which she had taken in 
the Pacific during the last war. In return, Japan restored to 
China the former German properties in Shantung and entered 
a Nine-Power Pact, signed by all nations with possessions in 
the Far East, guaranteeing the independence and territorial 
integrity of China and an Open Door for equal trade. These 
three conditions promised to protect China from Japan and 
to give her opportunity to become a strong and united nation. 

Japanese militarists were restive under the restrictions 
which they had accepted at the Washington Conference. 
They wanted a free hand in the Far East and power enough 

22 



to have their way in China. When Japan agreed with the 
United States and other naval powers at London in 1930 to 
limit cruisers and destroyers, in the inferior ratio of 10:7.5, 
jingoists in Tokyo assassinated Premier Hamaguchi for hu- 
miliating the nation. It was the first of many murders by 
which secret patriotic societies, all inspired by the militarists, 
got rid of those in office who opposed them. 

Controlled more and more by the Army, the Japanese 
Government embarked on a program of territorial expansion, 
seizing Manchuria in 1931 to acquire an "economic life line," 
attacking China to obtain the benefit of her markets and re- 
sources, and finally invading Southeast Asia to gain all the 
riches of the Far East. In order to conquer these territories, 
Japan claimed naval equality with the United States and 
Great Britain, who refused to grant it. Japan then notified 
them, in 1934, that she would not renew the treaties for 
naval limitation. 

Japan had now disregarded all the treaties negotiated at 
Washington and London to preserve peace in the Eastern 
Hemisphere. In order to acquire supremacy in the Far East, 
she secretly fortified her Pacific islands and built new air- 
craft carriers and battleships in the yards of the Inland Sea, 
closed to all foreign eyes after 1937. At the same time that 
Germany was rearming, Japan converted her industries to 
war production, and hastened to build a navy and equip an 
army caoable of challenging both America and Britain. 

The Japanese militarists, in alliance with the big business 
trusts which dominated the country, had come into their 
own. They had, in fact, always been strong in Japan. The 
Western nations made a mistake in thinking that the Japa- 
nese had Westernized all their institutions. The Government, 
for example, had the apparatus of a constitutional monarchy, 
and was actually modeled after the Prussia of Bismarck's 
day, but with three significant exceptions peculiar to Japan. 
The Emperor did not govern by consent of the governed, 
nor even by divine right, for he was himself worshipped as a 
descendant of the Sun Goddess, one who could do no wrong. 
The Constitution was a gift of the Japanese Emperor, who 

23 



remained above it and could alter it as he chose; it was 
neither framed nor won by the people in contest with their 
rulers as in the West. Actually, however, the Emperor did 
not conduct the business of government, which devolved 
upon elder statesmen, the Genro, and a Cabinet. In both these 
governing bodies the Army and Navy became supreme, be- 
cause the constitution provided that no Cabinet, for example, 
could hold office unless the military services were represented 
by generals and admirals of their own choice. It was, there- 
fore, a dual government in which the Army and Navy did 
what they wanted and the civilian Foreign Office tried to 
excuse their actions. 

Not only in government, but in social and economic in- 
stitutions, too, Japan has clung with one hand to her ancient 
ways and with the other grasped the Western technology of 
modern times to build up her industrial and military ma- 
chine. This mixture of the old and the new, so well illustrated 
by the incongruity of houses and clothes derived from both 
the East and West, has created discords in Japanese political 
and social life. Instead of changing feudal institutions to al- 
lay economic discontent at home, the people have evaded 
the problem by increasing their power and wealth abroad. A 
poverty-stricken peasantry has been conscripted into the 
Army to conquer new resources for industries owned by a 
few families. 

If Fascism, which can be variously defined, means among 
other things a military government in the interests of a mi- 
nority who hold or seek economic power, then Japan was 
the original Fascist state. Its military government goes back 
to the twelfth century. All opposition to it in the present 
century has been suppressed by the transformation of Shinto, 
a state religion which sprang up long ago with the worship 
of nature gods, into a patriotic cult of Emperor-worship. In 
this religion the medieval sin of heresy becomes one with 
the modern crime of treason; the individual knows only 
one allegiance, the Emperor, and the citizen's chief reward 
is to be deified in the Yasukuni Shrine with all the fallen 
soldiers who have given up their lives for the glory of the 
Emperor and a truculent, imperialistic Japan.

8. RISE OF THE DICTATORS 

Mussolini and Hitler were unscrupulous political agitators 
who rose to power by deception and violence. They appeared 
in countries where dissatisfaction with the existing weak 
Democratic governments was rife, and promised to solve so- 
cial problems at home as well as to achieve national aspira- 
tions abroad. They attracted industrialists and landlords by 
opposing Communism, the unemployed by promising work 
for all. They organized private armies of the dissatisfied, the 
ambitious, and the violent. These armies they used to intimi- 
date their opponents and the Government. Eventually each 
controlled a large political party and was appointed Prime 
Minister, but neither ever won an election until he was in 
control of the machinery of government and had the power 
to eliminate all opposition. 

Once in office, they used the authority of government to 
destroy all rival political parties and to extend their own 
power until individuals, corporations and societies were re- 
duced to virtual slavery and the state became a military 
tyranny, more complete and cruel than the past had ever 
known. Men found that they had lost their freedom to act, 
to speak their minds, even to think and live. This was 
Fascism, a system of government by force which could sur- 
vive only by conquering and plundering other nations. For 
this purpose all the human and material resources of Italy 
and Germany were mobilized with the utmost efficiency. If 
we are to understand the origins of World War II we must 
begin with the first conquests of Hitler and Mussolini, their 
subjection of the Italian and German peoples to the bondage 
of Fascism. 

The founder of Fascism was Benito Mussolini, the son of 
an Italian blacksmith. He was wounded as a corporal in the 
last war, and later became editor of a newspaper in Milan. 
Here [March 23, 1919] he organized a small political party 
with an extreme nationalist, anti-Communist program. The 
party recruited the discontented and violent, and by extrava- 
gant promises attracted many war veterans who were dis- 
satisfied with the disturbed political and economic condition 
of Italy after the war. They wore black shirts as a uniform, 

25 



used the old Roman greeting of the upraised arm as a salute, 
and adopted for their badge the fasces, a bundle of rods with 
an axe, ancient Roman symbol for the power of the State. 

One of the announced aims of the Fascists was a state 
powerful enough to maintain order. In the postwar depres- 
sion, when Socialist strikers occupied factories in the north 
and the Government failed to restrain them, forty thousand 
Fascists marched on Rome [October 28, 1922]. Mussolini 
followed his cohorts by train and cajoled the King into ap- 
pointing him Premier to restore law and order, which had 
in fact been disturbed as much by his Fascists as by the 
Communists. A year later Mussolini had consolidated his 
power sufficiently to decree that any party gaining one-fourth 
of the votes in the next election should have two-thirds of 
the seats in Parliament. By such mathematics the Fascists 
won control of the government in April 1924. When Black- 
shirts assassinated Giacomo Matteotti, leader of the Socialists 
[June 10, 1924], other parties joined the Socialists in a boy- 
cott of the Government, which Mussolini broke by arresting 
their leaders or driving them into exile. In 1926 he sup- 
pressed all political parties but his own and replaced the rep- 
resentative Parliament with a Fascist Grand Council com- 
posed of his puppets. 

Thus Italy lost all the institutions of political democracy 
— the individual his civil liberties, the people their right 
to vote, hold elections, and to participate in a representative 
government even when opposed to it — and became a one- 
party state. This party, the Fascist!, whose membership 
reached only one million in 1927, was thereafter limited to 
boys growing up in the military youth organizations. A small 
minority of Italians, then, were Fascists, but only Fascists 
had the power to rule Italy. This power they lodged in the 
hands of Mussolini by taking an oath to obey him. He was 
Duce (Leader), and his dictatorship, enforced by secret po- 
lice and the control of education and the press, was complete. 

Mussolini set to work building up an army and navy to 
make Italy strong among the nations of the world. Her des- 
tiny, in his imagination, was to conquer an empire in Africa 
and in the Mediterranean that would revive the glory of 
Imperial Rome, and exploit, as Rome had done, the resources 

26 



of other lands to repair the weakness and poverty of Italy. 
For this imperialist adventure Mussolini prepared the Italian 
people by abolishing their liberties and regimenting their 
lives. To secure industrial efficiency, for example, he prohib- 
ited strikes and forced all employers and labor unions into 
Fascist-controlled Corporations. Italy became a Corporate 
State in theory, but actually it was a semi-military dictator- 
ship with imperialistic ambitions. 

Although Mussolini had declared that Fascism was "not 
for export," since it was exclusively Italian in its ardent pa- 
triotism, a similar movement developed in Germany after 
the last war. Its Fiihrer (Leader), Adolf Hitler, proved to be 
abier and even more ambitious than Mussolini, more dan- 
gerous to the peace of the world because he gained control 
of Germany, a far larger and stronger state than Italy. 

Born an Austrian, son of a customs officer. Hitler grew 
up as a failure, eking out his living by painting postcards 
in Vienna. During the last war he served as orderly and 
lance corporal on the Western Front until he was disabled 
by mustard gas. After the war the German Army hired him 
to spy on radicals in Munich, where he fell in with malcon- 
tents who, like him, were stung by Germany's defeat. They 
organized a nationalist party to agitate for a stronger and 
more united Germany. In 1923 they tried to overthrow the 
government of their state, Bavaria, by staging a revolution 
which came to nothing more than a street riot. Sentenced to 
five years in jail. Hitler was released after eight months by 
the intervention of friends in high places. 

In jail Hitler wrote a book, Mein Kampj (My Battle), 
which became the textbook of his party, the National Social- 
ists or Nazis, whose nationalism always overshadowed their 
socialism. Basic was their belief in a Master Race, the mythi- 
cal "Aryans" which they considered best represented by the 
Nordic type of long-headed, blond Germans. This Master 
Race was threatened with destruction, according to Hitler, 
by a world-wide conspiracy of Jews either in the role of 
capitalists who impoverished the people or as German or 
Russian Communists who plotted revolution and war against 
the nation. Thus Hitler made the Jews the scapegoat for 

27 



everything which troubled Germany and called for a relent- 
less persecution to exterminate them. 

He was equally vindictive in his attacks upon the nations 
which had defeated Germany in the last war. Two myths he 
persuaded many Germans, perhaps the majority, to believe: 
that their armies were not defeated on the field of battle in 
1918, but suffered betrayal by a "stab in the back" from 
cowardly politicians at home; and that the Versailles Treaty, 
which the betrayers signed, was the severest peace ever dic- 
tated to a nation, reducing Germany to an ignominous posi- 
tion in Europe. Hitler proposed to break the fetters of the 
treaty, rearm Germany, crush France, and carve an empire 
out of Communist Russia. For this mission he demanded that 
the Nazis be made masters of Germany. 

At first the Nazis won little support, never polling a million 
votes until the world-wide depression of 1930. Up to that 
time intelligent people had regarded Hitler as a demagogue, 
more ridiculous than dangerous, and deplored the strong-arm 
tactics of his Brown Shirts as gutter politics. Yet the SA 
(Storm Troopers), together with the SS (Elite Guard), con- 
stituted a private army with which Hitler intimidated his 
opponents and defied the Government. As economic condi- 
tions grew worse, the masses turned to the parties which 
promised the most drastic changes, the Communists and the 
Nazis; and these revolutionary parties created a stalemate in 
the Reichstag (Parliament) by their uncompromising oppo- 
sition to the Government. In this crisis Marshal Hindenburg, 
hero of the last war, was reelected President over Hitler 
by a plurality of four million votes [April 10, 1932]. For all 
their violence, the Nazis were losing ground at the polls when 
powerful Rhineland industrialists came to Hitler's support to 
buy the protection of his party against the Communists. 
These manufacturers were joined by large landowners, the 
Junkers, whose estates in Prussia were threatened by agrarian 
reforms; and together the landowners and industrialists pre- 
vailed upon the aged Hindenburg to appoint Hitler as Chan- 
cellor of State [January 30, 1933]. 

Having gained his first public office, Hitler used it, as 
Mussolini had done, to make his power absolute. He first 
attempted to secure a mandate from the people by posing as 

28 



the man who had saved them from a Communist revolution. 
When the Reichstag building was burned, probably by Nazis 
themselves, Hitler charged the Communists with plotting 
against the Government, arrested their leaders, suspended the 
Constitution of the Republic, and decreed martial law [Feb- 
ruary 28, 1933] . Then he called an election [March 5, 1933] 
to take advantage of this "Red scare," but polled only forty- 
four per cent of the total vote. Since the people refused to 
make Hitler Dictator, he obtained the right to rule by per- 
sonal decree from a Reichstag purged of Communists and 
beaten into submission [March 23, 1933]. 

With the aid of his secret political police, the Gestapo, 
Hitler consolidated his power. He dissolved all political par- 
ties but that of the Nazis [March 1933], suppressed the 
trade unions [May 2, 1933], and drove Jews from the civil 
services and professions and deprived them of citizenship, put 
education and local government under the Nazis, and sub- 
ordinated the radical Storm Troopers to the Army by killing 
their leaders in a Blood Purge [June 30, 1934]. Germany 
became a land where people dared not oppose Hitler for fear 
of torture and the concentration camp. Not only were they 
ruled by force, but their whole economic life was reorganized 
to prepare the nation for war. 



9. THE AXIS WAR OF NERVES 

When Hitler came to power in 1933, eleven years after the 
advent of Mussolini, both Germany and Italy were too weak 
to risk war for the domination of Europe. Even when they 
combined their growing strength in the Rome-Berlin Axis 
[October 25, 1936], as Mussolini called his agreement to 
collaborate with Hitler, they were in danger of checkmate by 
Great Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, if these stronger 
nations acted together to defend the collective security of 
Europe. But the Axis divided them, claiming to be the cham- 
pion of Western Europe against Communist Russia, and 
paralyzed their will to resist by preying upon the twin fears 
of another world war and of Communist revolution. In what 
came to be known as a "war of nerves," the Axis increased its 

29 



power gradually, never striking directly at the larger nations 
but conquering or undermining, one by one, their smaller 
neighbors. Thus Germany and Italy recruited their military 
power, won strategic positions in Europe and Africa, and 
weakened their opponents abroad as they had done at home, 
until at last in 1939 they were strong enough to challenge 
the world in war. 

The first barrier to aggression which Mussolini and Hitler 
attacked was the League of Nations. The success of Japan in 
conquering and keeping Manchuria, despite the condemna- 
tion of the League and the United States, was a lesson to 
dictators that they could take what they wanted by armed 
force. Hitler, failing to obtain the consent of other nations to 
German rearmament, followed Japan out of the League [Oc- 
tober 14, 1933] and established military conscription in vio- 
lation of the Versailles Treaty. The treaty army of 100,000 
Germans was henceforth increased every year by 400,000 
newly trained men, and in addition there were 2,000,000 
Nazis who had some military training as party Storm Troops 
or Elite Guards. Upon this growing army Hitler based his 
aggressive diplomacy. 

It was Mussolini, however, with an army already trained, 
who delivered the final blow to the League of Nations by 
conquering one^f its member states, the independent African 
kingdom of Ethiopia. He made a border incident the excuse 
for an imperialistic war and refused to allow the League to 
settle the dispute peaceably. Half a million Fascist troops 
crushed the primitively armed tribes of Ethiopia with bomb- 
ing planes and poison gas [October 2, 1935-May 9, 1936]. 
The small nations in the League, realizing that what hap- 
pened to Ethiopia might also befall them, demanded that all 
the power of the League be used to stop Mussolini. Not only 
was Italy declared the aggressor in Ethiopia, but economic 
sanctions were invoked to halt the war [October 7, 1935]. 
The larger nations, however, failed to cut Italy off from such 
essential war supplies as iron, coal, and oil. France preferred 
to conciliate her neighbor, and Great Britain was afraid that 
Mussolini would make good his boastful threat of a naval war 
in the Mediterranean. 

While these nations were embarrassed by the Ethiopian 

30 



crisis, German troops marched into the Rhineland [March 
7, 1936], a region which had been demilitarized under the 
Locarno Pact signed by all the nations of Western Europe, 
including German}^ [November 16, 1925]. French troops did 
not oppose the Germans in the Rhineland, as they might 
easily have done, because on this occasion Great Britain 
shrank from supporting any move toward war. 

The German reoccupation of the Rhine, at a time when 
Italy was conquering Ethiopia, was the first of the double 
plays by which these nations, like Japan, scored off the other 
powers, a technique that became characteristic of Axis di- 
plomacy. It was also the beginning of a disastrous policy of 
appeasement on the part of France and Great Britain, whose 
diplomacy became weak and divided as one or the other took 
the lead in making concessions to the Axis in the hope of 
avoiding war. Mussolini and Hitler fed their delusion that 
peace could be preserved by tolerating aggression. Each new 
move the dictators made they solemnly promised would be 
the last. While they talked of peace, however, they also 
shouted threats of war, and so formidable was their growing 
military power that other nations submitted. 

The peace of Europe no longer depended on a concert of 
nations such as the League, but on the preponderance of 
military power which nations could establish by alliances. 
This the dictators understood. Italy left the League [Decem- 
ber 11, 1937], following Germany, and then sought the alli- 
ance of Japan, the third outstanding aggressor. Germany took 
all Europe, Italy the Mediterranean, and Japan the Far East, 
for their prospective spheres of expansion. The Axis was now 
extended to Tokyo through the Anti-Comintern Pact, origin- 
ally signed by Germany and Japan [N ovember 25, 1936], 
and later indorsed by Italy [N ovember 6, 1937], which was 
ostensibly aimed at the Communist International sponsored 
by the Soviet Union. Actually the pact had the effect of join- 
ing Germany, Japan, and Italy in an alliance stronger than 
any other existing alliance, and of dividing the nations of 
Europe by playing on their fear of Communism. 

When Spanish Fascists under General Franco rebelled 
against the Republican Government, and civil war broke out 
in Spain, the Axis came to the aid of the rebels on the pretext 

31 



of suppressing Communism, although there were few Com- 
munists in Spain and the Government was not Communistic. 
In the course of two years Italy sent more than 100,000 
troops to Franco's assistance, and Germany supplied him 
with tanks, artillery, aircraft, and the trained men of the 
Condor Legion. For the Axis, Spain was not only a potential 
ally, hemming in France on the south and threatening Eng- 
land at Gibraltar, but a testing ground for new weapons. To 
offset the help which the Axis gave Franco, the Soviet Union 
and France at first encouraged volunteers with arms and 
planes to go to the defense of the Republican Government. 
When it appeared that the Spanish Civil War might involve 
all Europe, because of the interference of other nations, Rus- 
sia and France agreed to abstain from further intervention, 
and obtained a similar pledge from the Axis. Germany and 
Italy continued to support Franco, hardly troubling to con- 
ceal the travesty they were making of the non-intervention 
agreement. Meanwhile Great Britain and France accepted 
the delusion, believing that in doing so they were averting the 
greater evils of Communism in Spain and war in Europe. 
After two and a half years of bitter fighting in Spain, marked 
by the prolonged siege of Madrid and a final offensive against 
Barcelona, Franco won a complete victory [April 4, 1939] 
with the help of the Axis. 

While Italy and Germany were having their way in Ethi- 
opia, in the Rhineland, and in Spain, the United States was 
becoming as apprehensive of war as France and Great Britain 
were. Many Americans believed that it had been a mistake for 
the United States to enter the last war. This mood of disil- 
lusion grew out of a conviction that we were drawn into the 
last war solely because of our trade with the Allies and the 
sinking of our ships by German submarines. The prospect of 
another great conflict in Europe, and the desire to prevent a 
repetition of the circumstances which had involved us per- 
suaded the United States Congress in 1934 and 1935 to pass 
so-called neutrality laws which put an embargo on the supply 
of credits or munitions to any belligerent nation, and pro- 
hibited American ships from venturing into war zones. These 
laws, renewed in 1937, were not relaxed until November 4, 
1939, when the embargo on munitions was lifted to permit 

32 



other nations to buy them on a "cash-and-carry" basis. To 
many Americans, the neutrality laws appeared to be the only 
way to stay out of war; but to the peoples of Europe and 
Asia they signified that the United States had retreated into 
complete isolation, preferring peace for America even if it 
meant the triumph of Fascism over the rest of the world. 

The American Government, however, based its diplomacy 
from the summer of 1937 on the conviction that the joint 
ambitions of Germany and Japan were to conquer Europe 
and Asia. "Since August a year ago," the Secretary of State, 
Cordell Hull, told the Canadian Minister [September 21, 
1938], "I have proceeded here on the theory that Japan 
definitely contemplates securing domination over as many 
hundreds of millions of people as possible in eastern Asia and 
gradually extending her control through the Pacific islands 
to the Dutch East Indies and elsewhere, thereby dominating 
in practical effect one-half of the world; and that she is 
seeking this objective by any and every kind of means; and 
... at the same time I have gone on the theory that Ger- 
many is equally bent on becoming the dominating colossus of 
continental Europe." Taking this point of view, the American 
Government was hampered by the neutrality laws. It "had to 
move," according to the State Department,"within the frame- 
work of a gradual evolution of public opinion in the United 
States away from the idea of isolation expressed in 'neu- 
trality' legislation and toward realization that the Axis design 
was a plan of world conquest in which the United States was 
intended to be a certain, though perhaps ultimate, victim, 
and that our primary policy therefore must be defense against 
actual and mounting danger." The American people did not 
fully awaken to the need for defense until Hitler had con- 
quered France; and in a democracy like the United States, 
the Government could move no faster than the people. 

The growing military power of Hitler made him bold. He 
spoke no longer, as he had at first, of obtaining for Germany 
nothing more than a position of equality with the other na- 
tions of Europe. His ambitions now were to unify all Germans 
living in Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Poland, and to find for 
them what he called Lebensraum (living space) in other coun- 
tries. To pave the way for the expansion of Germany, Hitler 

2>2> 



inspired Nazi movements abroad in order to create dissension 
in foreign governments and eventually overthrow them under 
the pretext of rescuing his followers in those countries. 

A Nazi party in Austria agitated for Anschluss (union 
with Germany) and the Austrian Government was too weak, 
after it suppressed the Socialists and lost the support of Italy, 
to resist Hitler. German troops invaded and annexed Austria 
[Marchl2,1938] . Europe was stunned, but no country dared 
risk war to compel Germany's withdrawal. Hitler declared, 
as he had after the reoccupation of the Rhineland, that he 
had no further territorial ambitions in Europe. 

The next country to fall prey to his tactics of fomenting 
disorder within its borders by the clamor of a native Nazi 
party, and then sending his army to occupy it, was Czecho- 
slovakia. The Sudeten Germans on its strategic northern 
frontier at first demanded autonomy or home rule, but when 
the Czech Government granted this upon the mediation of 
Great Britain, the Sudeten Nazis cried out for annexation to 
Germany. As Hitler mobilized his forces, threatening war, 
Czechoslovakia stood fast with a strong army on its fortified 
frontier, depending for support on an alliance with France. 
The French called up reserves, and Great Britain warned 
Hitler that she would aid France if the latter went to the 
defense of Czechoslovakia. The Soviet Union, whose earlier 
proposal for consultation among the non-Axis powers to as- 
sure the collective security of all had been rejected by Great 
Britain, was joined to France and Czechoslovakia by mutual 
assistance pacts. In view of these pledges and understandings, 
all pivoting on Czechoslovakia, the European crisis in the 
summer of 1938 was the supreme test of the power of the 
Axis to break all opposition. 

The opposition was weak, however, because neither Great 
Britain nor France was as well prepared for war as Germany, 
and the failure of France to implement its pact with the 
Soviet Union, as the latter had requested, made their alliance 
fragile. France leaned heavily upon Great Britain, whose 
Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain flew twice to Germany 
to confer with Hitler in an effort to appease him. Both the 
British and the French exerted tremendous pressure upon 
Czechoslovakia to reach a settlement satisfactory to Ger- 

34 



many. Mussolini intervened at what appeared to be the last 
minute to arrange a conference at Munich [September 29 j 
1938\, from which the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia were 
excluded, and Hitler won the assent of Great Britain and 
France to his demands. 

The triumph of the Axis at Munich saved the peace of 
Europe for the time being but made war inevitable. Not only 
was Czechoslovakia robbed of its strong defenses and exposed 
to the power of Germany, but all the smaller nations of 
Europe lost faith in their protective alliances with France. 
The only bulwark they had against the Axis, after the failure 
of the League of Nations, was gone. Even more disastrous to 
the peace of Europe was the fact that the Axis had divided 
its strongest opponents by the exclusion of the Soviet Union 
from the Munich Conference and the pact made there to guar- 
antee the diminished borders of Czechoslovakia. The Rus- 
sians looked with suspicion upon Franco-British appease- 
ment of the Axis as deliberate encouragement of Germany to 
expand eastward. When Prime Minister Chamberlain re- 
turned from Munich with a gentlemen's agreement pledging 
Germany and Great Britain to consultation, the English peo- 
ple hoped that it would mean, as he said, "peace in our time," 
but the Russians wondered at whose expense. 

Great Britain was soon disabused of its trust in Hitler 
when his troops in the following spring marched into Prague 
\March 15, 1939] and occupied all that was left of Czecho- 
slovakia. It was evident that Hitler had only been appeased, 
not satisfied, at Munich. 

Two weeks later, on April 7, 1939, in another Axis double 
play, Italy invaded and occupied Albania. Mussolini dared to 
attack his weak neighbor across the Adriatic because on Jan- 
uary 30, 1939, Hitler had promised to support him if any 
other nation interfered. Of the nations conquered by the Axis, 
only Czechoslovakia had received so comprehensive a guar- 
antee as Germany now gave Italy. 

The destruction of Czechoslovakia wakened Great Britain 
and France to the insatiable ambitions of the Axis. They 
abandoned the policy of appeasement and sought desperately 
to establish a "Peace Front" of the smaller nations as a 
barrier to German expansion. Turkey, Greece, Rumania, and 

35 



Poland were promised armed support if the Axis attacked 
them [April 6-13, 1939]. Hitler singled out his next victim 
[April 28, 1939] by denouncing the non-aggression pact 
which he had made with Poland in 1934 and the naval treaty 
of 1935 with Britain, the new ally of Poland. Then he entered 
a full military alliance with Mussolini [May 22, 1939]. 

"With united strength to secure their Lebensraum," Italy 
demanded Corsica, Nice, Savoy, and Tunisia from France, 
and Germany called upon Poland to yield control of the 
Polish Corridor, only one-tenth of whose population was 
German, including the Free City of Danzig. The Poles had 
been willing to negotiate their differences with Germany, hav- 
ing profited from the partition of Czechoslovakia, until they 
realized that Hitler was playing the same game with them that 
had cost the Czechs their existence as a nation. Just as Hitler 
had protested violently about the outrages which he alleged 
the Czechs perpetrated upon Sudeten Germans, so now he 
stormed against the treatment which the Poles, acting in self- 
defense, were meting out to the Nazis in the Corridor. 

The Anglo-French guarantee of military aid to Poland de- 
pended upon the cooperation of the Soviet Union, for only 
Russian troops could conceivably protect Poland against 
Germany. A Russian proposal, made in March, that all the 
nations of the Peace Front meet with the Soviets to organize 
their strength for collective security was rejected by Great 
Britain. All that Britain desired was consultation in case of 
attack. As Hitler threatened war on Poland, her new allies. 
Great Britain and France, made belated and half-hearted 
efforts to close the breach which Munich had opened between 
them and the Soviet Union [August 10, 1939]. But these 
dilatory attempts to reach a military understanding with the 
Russians came to nothing, because Poland had refused to 
admit Soviet troops, even in a war against Germany, and the 
Russians had insisted upon a guarantee of the Baltic border 
republics, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, which Britain and 
France were loath to give. Mutual suspicions and recrimina- 
tions, not only between the Russians and the western nations 
but also among the smaller eastern nations and their giant 
neighbor, prevented the formation of a common front against 
the Axis. 

36 



In August the Soviet Union suddenly abandoned its vain 
efforts to collaborate with other nations menaced by the Axis 
and went into isolation, preferring to assure its own safety 
rather than to risk the chance of becoming involved alone 
in a war with the Axis. Ever since Munich, the Russians had 
been afraid that Great Britain and France were seeking peace 
for themselves by encouraging Hitler to expand eastward. 
Now they turned the tables upon the western nations, mak- 
ing a trade agreement with Germany [August 19, 1939] fol- 
lowed by a nonaggression pact [August 23, 1939] which 
pledged both countries to settle all disputes for ten years 
by peaceful consultation. The Soviet Union made no alliance 
with the Germans, but its pact had much the same effect. 
It left Poland to the mercies of Hitler and assured him that 
the Russians would not join France and Great Britain, as in 
the last war, to fight Germany on two fronts. Hitler was free 
to act as he chose against the divided nations of Europe. 
Weak, and ill-prepared for war, they would fight back, but 
each for its own survival.

PART THREE 
THE AXIS THREATENS AMERICA 

10. HITLER CONQUERS EUROPE 

In 1939 Hitler was ready to wage war for the conquest of 
Europe. The armed forces which he had always threatened to 
use in his war of nerves were made ready for a showdown in 
the year following Munich. He no longer resorted to a show 
of diplomacy. The ancient stratagem of ''divide and rule" 
which had inspired his bargaining with the nations of Europe 
would now be tested on the battlefield. To conquer a united 
Europe was impossible. Even to fight on two fronts against 
a coalition of powers, as Germany learned in the last war, 
could be disastrous. But war on one front at a time promised 
the conquest of every country in its turn. Hitler's diplomatic 
policy in the years of peace had been to gain one objective 
at a time; now it was his military strategy in a war of con- 
quest. Poland was the first victim. 

I. BLITZKRIEG IN POLAND 

German troops invaded Poland without a declaration of 
war [September 1, 1939]. The night before they marched, 
Hitler dropped any pretense of getting Danzig and the Polish 
Corridor by diplomacy. His "sixteen points" were broadcast 
for propaganda to the German, not the Polish people, as he 
ordered his armies to march. The two air fleets of Kesselring 
and Lohr delivered Hitler's ultimatum to the Polish people 
in the form of bombs. They struck at thirty-six towns in 
Poland, caught a small air force on the ground, cut all rail- 
roads, and crippled the mobilization of reserves. 

Within sixteen days the Polish armies were completely 
broken, and in less than a month Poland was overrun by 
Nazis. This quick victory surprised the world, for the Polish 
Army was the fifth largest in all Europe. But it was not pre- 
pared to fight an enemy equipped with the tanks and planes 
of the Nazis. The Poles looked for rain, which never came, to 
bog down the tanks in mud, and depended on eight brigades 

38 



of cavalry to stop fourteen mechanized divisions. Such forces, 
as the Poles had, twenty-two divisions of infantry, they failed 
to concentrate, but spread them out along the frontiers which 
Germany enclosed on three sides. 

German strategy was designed to annihilate the Polish 
forces in one decisive battle by a maneuver known as the 
double envelopment. It has been the aim of all strategists, but 
of none more than the German General Staff. In the Battle of 
Poland they applied it on a grand scale, not once but twice, 
and the second double envelopment trapped forces escaping 
the first. Bock's armies in the north, descending from East 
Prussia and striking across the Polish Corridor from Pomer- 
ania, joined with Rundstedt's armies from Silesia and Slo- 
vakia in the south to forge two rings of steel around Warsaw. 

New weapons gave Germany the tactical power and speed 
to carry out this strategy. Planes and tanks supported the 
infantry in breaking through enemy lines and rolling up their 
flanks. Wherever Polish defenses were weak, Nazi infantry 
punched holes in them with tanks, then exploited by driving 
through and enveloping the flanks on either side of the gap. 
Stukas — dive-bombing planes — ranged the skies as a flying 
artillery; and fast-moving infantry, often motorized, swept 
forward as much as forty-five miles in a day. This was Blitz- 
krieg — lightning war. The internal-combustion engines, ar- 
mor, and fire power of planes and tanks worked miracles until 
defense was improved to foil them. 

The Battle of Poland first demonstrated the offensive pow- 
er of the armored division which, with its supporting units, 
was an effective combination of tanks and motorized infan- 
try. The Nazi panzer (armored) division of 14,000 men, 450 
tanks, and 3,000 motorized vehicles was organized in three 
echelons. For reconnaissance there were a battalion of fifty 
armored cars and a company of motorcycle infantry. Two 
regiments of tanks made up the shock force. The ground- 
holding force comprised two regiments of motorized infantry, 
one of artillery, and engineer, signal, and antitank companies. 
The Germans did not rely so much on tanks in the battle of 
Poland as on the old horse-drawn artillery and on infantry 
divisions whose fire power they increased tremendously with 
442 machine guns, 135 mortars, 72 antitank guns, and 24 

39 



howitzers. It was the infantry, supported by tanks and 
planes, which won the Battle of Poland. 

In this campaign Rundstedt's armies in the southwest de- 
livered the main blow toward Warsaw. One of his armies, the 
Tenth under Reichenau, trapped sixty thousand Poles west of 
Radom, and penetrated with tanks to the outskirts of Warsaw 
in a week [September 8, 1939]. From the north the Third 
and Fourth Armies converged under Kiichler and Kluge to 
cut off eighty thousand troops in the Polish Corridor and then 
swept forward to Warsaw. 

Against these three drives the Poles fought in vain. Dive 
bombers broke up their retreat and prevented reserves from 
coming to their rescue. At Kutno over 170,000 soldiers of the 
Posen Army were encircled and captured [September 15, 
1939]. The northern Nazi forces pierced the heart of the 
country when they crossed the Narew River near Modlin and 
swept behind Warsaw [September 14, 1939]. From Slovakia 
in the south, List's army enveloped the Polish industries of 
Silesia, taking care not to destroy war plants, and thrust out 
an arm to Lwow to shut off any escape into Rumania. Two 
nets were thus cast around Warsaw as Kiichler's troops met 
Reichenau's tanks at Siedlce [September 17, 1939], and 
List's advance units farther southeast at Brest-Litovsk 
[September 28, 1939]. Although Warsaw did not surrender 
until large parts of the city were destroyed by bombardment, 
effective Polish resistance came to an end when the northern 
and southern German armies drew their nets tight around 
the capital and caught the remnants of the Polish armies. 

Partition of Poland 

Halfway through the Nazi campaign the Russian Army 
marched into Poland [September 17, 1939], without meeting 
any opposition to secure a strategic frontier against Germany. 
The Nazis agreed [September 28, 1939] to a new boundary 
between Russia and the territory they now dominated, the 
line flanking East Prussia and running south along the Bug 
River and west of Lwow to include eastern Galicia. Except 
for strategic salients this frontier followed the Curzon Line 
proposed in 1919 by the Allies on ethnic grounds. Although 
a majority of the inhabitants in the area taken over by 

40 



Russia were White Russians, Ukrainians, and members of 
smaller non-Polish groups, Poland did not accept the Curzon 
Line, and in a war against the Soviet Union in 1920 had 
regained much of the territory now taken once more by- 
Russia. When Russian plebiscites showed a majority of voters 
in favor of annexation [November 3, 1939], eastern Poland 
with a population of twelve million was incorporated into the 
Soviet Union, providing it with a buffer zone of defense and 
setting a limit to Nazi expansion eastward. 

Hitler had his triumph in Warsaw [October 5, 1939]. He 
added western Poland, with a population of ten million to 
Germany and assumed a "protectorate" over central Poland, 
to which all Poles and Jews in the west were to be trans- 
ferred. Here the Poles were reduced to slavery, and the Polish 
Jews were confined to ghettos and gradually exterminated. In 
the course of the next two years over a million Poles were 
forced to work in Germany. The Polish Government fled to 
Rumania, and finally to London, where several thousand 
Polish soldiers and fliers were to carry on the war from Eng- 
land. A strong Underground movement developed in Poland 
which the Nazis were unable to crush even by torture and 
mass murder. 

Sitzkrieg 

When Germany attacked Poland, Great Britain and 
France declared war [September 3, 1939], fulfilling their 
pledge to defend Polish independence. They took up the 
fight against what Prime Minister Chamberlain called the 
"evil things" of Fascism. But they were not ready to give 
Poland effective help. France mobilized fortress troops in the 
Maginot Line, pushed forward patrols, made a limited attack 
on the Saar Basin, and spent the winter in a vain attempt to 
produce planes and tanks for her badly equipped armies. No 
offensive was launched on a second front to relieve Poland. 

Nor was Great Britain able to rally as quickly as in the last 
war. A month went by before a small expeditionary force took 
up defensive positions in France. There was almost no aerial 
bombing of Germany, perhaps for fear of reprisals, since the 
Nazis boasted many more bombers than the Allies. Both 
France and England thought of war as passive self-defense, 

41 



and neither nation was mobilized to take the offensive. They 
established a naval blockade to starve Germany out, as they 
had done in the last war, while they tried to produce enough 
tanks and planes to meet Hitler whenever he should choose 
to attaci^ them. 

Cynics accused England and France of opposing blitzkrieg 
with sitzkrieg, a sitting war, and some Americans called it a 
''phony war" because there were no major actions through 
the winter of 1939-40. The critics overlooked the fact, how- 
ever, that Great Britain and France had declared war on 
Hitler, refused his offer of peace after Poland was conquered 
{October 12, 1939], and insisted that the war must go on 
until both Czechoslovakia and Poland were set free. There 
was to be no more appeasement. Hitler had conquered Po- 
land; but he could not keep his spoils without conquering 
France and Great Britain too. 

II. INVASION OF DENMARK AND NORWAY 

Denmark and Norway remained neutral through the last 
war, but now their geographic position to the north of Ger- 
many robbed them of peace in this great struggle. Because 
these countries outflanked Germany, it was essential for 
the Allies to prevent German use of them, and mines were 
finally laid off the Norwegian coast by the British Navy 
[April 8, 1940]. This coast offered Germany an extended 
maritime front from which to attack Britain with planes 
and U-boats, and the ice-free port of Narvik in the north 
was an outlet for the Swedish iron ore so necessary to Ger- 
man war industries. Hence the Nazis occupied Norway [April 
9, 1940]. They also turned on Denmark because it lay in 
their path and bordered the waters of the Skagerrak and 
Kattegat controlHng the sea routes to the Baltic, Sweden, 
and the northeast coast of Germany. 

The Nazi conquest of these maritime countries called for 
tactics different from those of the Polish campaign. Since 
airplanes could span both sea and land, the Nazis oriented 
their strategy to the air, seized airfields, and brought in 
mortar and machine-gun troops by plane. In this daring 
operation Nazi airborne infantry and parachute battalions 
weathered their first test. Although the Germans commanded 

42 



the air, they did not rule the seas. To prevent a superior 
British Navy from carrying out the expectation of every 
Englishman and making Norwegian and Danish waters im- 
passable, the Nazis mined the Kattegat, patrolled the North 
Sea with submarines in force, and drove off hostile warships 
with land-based bombers. It was the first campaign of the 
war in which air power successfully challenged sea power 
and proved that aerial cover was essential to ships operating 
in coastal waters. 

What startled Norway and the whole world was not only 
the Nazi invasion, but the tactics by which a "fifth column" 
made it a success. The name had been coined by Franco's 
General Mola in the Spanish Civil War when he boasted that 
the four Fascist columns advancing on Madrid would be 
helped by a fifth column of sympathizers within the Loyalist 
capital. In Norway the Nazis recruited a powerful fifth col- 
umn among discontented natives and German residents. 
Chief was Major Vidkun Quisling, leader of a small Nazi 
party, whose name became the epithet for traitorous leaders 
in every land. Once the invasion of Norway began, the fifth 
column seized radio and telephone communications to send 
counterfeit orders which confused the small army of de- 
fenders, paralyzed mobilization, and directed forts and ships 
to surrender. 

Nazi Invasion 

German forces under General Nikolaus von Falkenhorst 
seized both Denmark and Norwa}^ at once [April 9, 1940]. 
For the amphibious tactics required by this operation reserve 
divisions had been carefully rehearsed during the winter in 
East Prussia. They overran Denmark in a day. The country 
could offer no resistance with a land frontier open only to 
Germany, a population of scarcely four million, and a weak 
militia. Naval landings took place at Copenhagen and Mid- 
delfart [April 9-11, 1940]. From these ports and the air- 
field at Aalborg reinforcements flowed north to Norway. 

The Nazis caught three million Norwegians off guard. 
Their little army of 1 14,000 men was never wholly mobilized, 
and the six divisions which took the field were confused and 
unprepared. Oslo, the capital city commanding a strategic 

43 



fjord, woke up on the morning of invasion to find its two 
airfields in the hands of the German agents, with transport 
planes already landing an infantry force of three thousand 
men, and its coastal batteries under fire from Nazi warships. 
The powerful guns at Fort Oskarsborg, were supposed to 
have been spiked by fifth columnists, but they sank the 
heavy German cruiser Blucher, and a Norwegian minelayer 
crippled the Emden before fifth column signals stopped their 
fire. From Oslo three divisions of German infantry fanned 
out in spearheads to occupy southern Norway, make con- 
tact with forces holding western ports, and strike the rear 
of such Norwegian troops as gathered in the mountains to 
the north. Oslofjord was soon won [April 15, 1940] and the 
first Norwegian division to muster its forces was threatened 
with a double envelopment as it retreated eastward into 
Sweden. 

At the start of the invasion, amphibious units also landed 
at the secondary ports of Kristiansand on the Skagerrak, 
and at Bergen, Trondheim, and Narvik on the Atlantic coast 
[April 9, 1940]. The North Sea port of Stavanger fell to 
five thousand airborne infantry. Serious resistance was met 
only at Kristiansand, where a fort battery sank the cruiser 
Karlsruhe. In one day the Germans had seized Norway's 
principal harbors and — like a spider spinning its web — 
connected these ports and strengthened their lines with air- 
borne reinforcements and supplies. 

British Counterattacks 

The British Navy had failed to forestall the invasion of 
Norway. Allied troops tried too late to undo it. Trondheim, 
center of a railway network extending across the mountains 
to Sweden, was the objective of an expeditionary force of 
about thirty thousand men. They landed at Namsos and 
Andalsnes [April 14-20, 1940], one hundred miles north 
and south of the city, with heavy losses from German bomb- 
ers. It was an ill-fated expedition, lacking both air cover and 
antiaircraft artillery, and its supply bases like its advance 
columns were always under bombardment by the Luftwaffe. 
As the Allies moved inland to Dombaas, German troops struck 
at them from three directions [April 30, 1940], out of Trond- 

44 



heim, up the valleys from Oslo, and in a surprise flanking 
blow through the mountain passes in the east. Norwegian 
divisions were cut off one by one [May 1-2, 1940] as the 
Allies fell back from Dombaas to Storen and evacuated Nam- 
sos and Andalsnes under furious bombing. 

The last desperate effort of the British in Norway was 
to take and to hold the iron port of Narvik in the north, 
which had been captured the first morning of the invasion 
by nine German destroyers and occupied by infantry smug- 
gled aboard a freighter. Five British destroyers stormed the 
port next day and two were lost. The battleship Warspite 
led nine destroyers back to avenge their loss and sank all 
the German craft [April 13, 1940]. Then British troops 
landed south and north of Narvik but could not maneuver 
in deep snow against German units reinforced by air from 
Trondheim [May 27-28, 1940]. Another British landing 
nearer Narvik secured the port for a brief spell until German 
planes based on Trondheim compelled the British to aban- 
don [June 8-9, 1940] this beleaguered spot, taking with 
them the King and Crown Prince of Norway. Nazi occu- 
pation of the country was complete [June 10, 1940], and 
Great Britain was outflanked in the north. 

"Blood, toil, tears, and sweat" 

Hitler did not conquer Norway without losses. German 
casualties were slight, running from 35,000 to 55,000. But 
the Navy suffered severely on convoy duty, with the sinking 
of one heavy and two light cruisers, eleven destroyers, and 
six submarines. Germany's naval force never had been ade- 
quate for fleet action, as in the last war, but now it was 
weaker than ever. At least nine-tenths of the Norwegian 
merchant marine escaped Hitler's clutches. When he in- 
vaded their ports, everyone of the 1,024 ships at sea obeyed 
their Government's orders to put in at British ports, where 
they later became a valuable addition to Allied supply con- 
voys, some two hundred Norse tankers carrying two-fifths 
of the gasoline which the Royal Air Force consumed in the 
Battle of Britain. The most ominous misfortune which be- 
fell Hitler as a result of his success in Norway was that the 
British lion was aroused. Neville Chamberlain, the Prime 

45 



Minister who failed to secure "peace in our time" at Munich, 
gave way to Winston Churchill, First Lord of the Admiralty 
[May 10, 1940], and to a coalition cabinet of war-minded 
Conservatives, Liberals, and Laborites. All that Churchill 
could promise his countrymen was "blood, toil, tears, and 
sweat." "Our only aim is victory," he said, "for without 
victory there is no survival" [May 13, 1940]. 

III. FALL OF FRANCE AND THE LOW COUNTRIES 

Great Britain and France were not yet ready to fight when 
Hitler's armies turned west to crush them [May 10, 1940]. 
Nazi forces swept across the borders of Holland, Belgium, 
and the little state of Luxembourg on a swift drive into 
France which brought them complete victory in one month. 
This campaign. Hitler told his troops, was to "decide the 
fate of the German nation for the next thousand years." 
He swore vengeance for the defeat Germany had suffered 
in the last war. The hereditary enemy, France, was to be 
destroyed. The Nazis planned to repeat the victory won in 
the Franco-Prussian War, but on a far grander scale with 
the conquest of both France and England. Then Germany 
would be supreme in Europe. This was Hitler's ambition 
in 1940. 

Weakness of France 

To achieve it the Nazis had mobilized an overwhelming 
force. Between six and seven million Germans were organ- 
ized in 240 divisions, of which at least twelve were armored 
and the rest were infantry and artillery. The Luftwaffe 
boasted about nine thousand combat planes. French Intelli- 
gence estimated that of this huge army more than a hundred 
infantry divisions, all tank units, and two air fleets with an 
array of 1,500 fighters and 3,500 bombers were massed on 
the Western Front. 

To oppose them the French had mobilized ninety-five di- 
visions. About one-third of these units were made up of 
older reserves with only a year of training; thirteen divi- 
sions garrisoned the Maginot Line, and three were armored 
with 480 tanks, little more than the strength of one panzer 
division. Other battalions had light tanks left over from the 

46 



last war. The French Air Force in action did not exceed one 
thousand planes. Ground units had no antitank and not 
enough antiaircraft guns. The allies of France were even less 
prepared. Britain had sent to France an expeditionary force 
of thirteen divisions, with three still in training, seven regi- 
ments and two battalions of light tanks, and air squadrons 
of about seven hundred planes. The Belgian Army, poorly 
trained and badly equipped, was organized in twenty-one 
regular divisions with twelve of them along the fortified 
Albert Canal. The Dutch Army enrolled 400,000 men on 
paper, but had no machines with which to fight a mechan- 
ized war. 

It was not only this lack of planes, tanks, and guns which 
made France weak. The French did not even concentrate 
all their force and materiel against Germany. They kept 
many of their best troops in Syria and Africa, nearly half 
of their planes on the border of Italy in fear of an attack 
from the Italians, and dispersed tanks and planes alike in 
"little packages" among their divisions. 

What led the French to defeat was their strategy, leader- 
ship, and internal class strife. They had lost the offensive 
spirit which saved them in the last war. Their strategy was 
to hold the Maginot forts and to fight a long war of posi- 
tion on a continuous front, with massed infantry for defense, 
until attrition should sap the strength of the enemy. Mili- 
tary leadership suffered from the "Maginot mentality"; the 
fate of France was staked on the forts, which had been built 
at a cost of two million dollars a mile, with their big guns 
pointing east. Premier Daladier, General Gamelin, Marshal 
Petain, like the people whom they led, were tired victors 
who wished only to keep what France had and to be left 
alone in peace. 

French patriotism was so paralyzed by class hatred that 
some leaders of business and politics thought of their pock- 
etbooks before their country. There was a fifth column in 
places of power: men who preferred to collaborate with Hit- 
ler, or even to have him rule France, in order to avoid the 
Communism which they feared would be the result of Labor 
gains like the forty-hour week. France was weak on the field 

47 



of battle because it was so badly divided and poorly led at 
home. 

Nazi Strategy and Tactics 

German strategy, true to the teachings of Clausewitz, did 
not aim to capture Paris but to annihilate the opposing 
armies. This same attempt had been made in 1914 under 
the Schlieffen Plan of outflanking the French Army through 
Belgium. In 1940, however, with an extension of the Magi- 
not Line reaching the sea, France could be outflanked only 
through Switzerland, too limited and mountainous a terrain 
for maneuver. Hence the Germans decided upon a strategic 
penetration of the center to expose flanks which could be 
enveloped. Such attacks had bogged down in the last war 
because infantry lacked the speed to exploit a breakthrough 
before it was closed with defensive reserves. But the strength 
of defense to obstruct maneuver had been broken in Poland. 
There heavier mortars and howitzers had demonstrated how 
they could increase the offensive fire power of infantry, while 
tanks gave them mobile support or with dive bombers made 
up a flying wedge, the armored spearhead. 

With the tactics made possible by these weapons the Ger- 
mans chose to surprise the French at the weakest point of 
their fortifications. This was at the hinge of the Maginot 
Line in the Ardennes Forest along the Meuse River, where 
the main works ended and lighter defenses ran northwest 
to the sea between France and Belgium. The Nazis knew 
that if they penetrated French defenses at this point and 
pressed forward to the Channel coast, they could drive be- 
tween the Allied forces which moved north to hold Belgium 
and those which remained in France, and hence open the 
flanks of both to envelopment. After the destruction of the 
Allied forces in Belgium, the Germans could swing south on 
either side of Paris, overrun the west, and take the Maginot 
Line in the rear. In support of this plan the Netherlands 
were to be occupied, to prevent British landings and counter- 
attacks on the Ruhr, and Belgium was to be invaded to 
draw the Allies north to its aid. As Hitler explained the 
strategy of his generals, in July 1940, after it had proved 
successful: 'T feinted to the north and moved my main 

48 



mass against the left wing in contrast to the Schlieifen Plan 
[which moved by the right wing in 1914]. The feint suc- 
ceeded." 

Fall of Holland and Belgium 

The German feint was the more effective because the 
defensive plans of France and England changed often dur- 
ing the year of stalemated action, and never really covered 
the exposed flank of Belgium and the Netherlands. These 
small nations remained aloof from friend and foe, hugging 
the illusion that neutrality would preserve them. When they 
found themselves outflanked by the Nazi occupation of 
Norway and Denmark, it was too late to close the natural 
corridor which their lowlands opened to a German attack 
on France and England. When it came, British and French 
forces moved north to fight a delaying action in the Nether- 
lands and to strengthen the strong Belgian defenses along 
the Albert Canal. But they moved too late and with too little. 

In the first week of invasion [May 10-16, 1940] the Nazis 
compelled the Dutch to surrender and drove the Belgians 
from the Albert Canal. Parachute troops seized Dutch air- 
fields, bridges, and highways, and with reinforcements of 
airborne infantry secured the bridges over which German 
motorized troops quickly reached Rotterdam. This port was 
almost destroyed [May 14, 1940] by Nazi bombers to ter- 
rorize the Government and people into surrender. Utrecht, 
The Hague, and Amsterdam were threatened with destruc- 
tion from the air. Resistance became hopeless and the Dutch 
surrendered [May 16, 1940]. 

In Belgium, where many bridges remained undemolished, 
the Germans reached the Albert Canal in two days [May 
11, 1940] and captured its chief strongpoint. Fort Eben 
Emael, by investing it with parachutists while specially 
trained engineers made a frontal assault with explosives 
and flamethrowers. As the Nazis threw bridgeheads across 
the Albert Canal, the Belgians retired to stand with British 
and French forces on the main defense line of the Dyle 
River. Their situation soon became desperate, however, be- 
cause of the German breakthrough to the south. 

49 



Breakthrough to the Channel 

There, in France, was the crucial attack. Kleist's armored 
divisions had crossed Luxembourg and southern Belgium 
[May 10-11, 1940] through the dense Ardennes Forest 
under orders that "this side of the Meuse River there can 
be no rest or halt for a man of this column." They turned 
back mechanized French cavalry which was advancing to 
cover General Corap's Ninth Army as it pivoted north of 
Sedan to swing eastward and defend the Meuse. This French 
maneuver was forestalled by a surprising onrush of German 
tanks. A division under Rommel crossed the Meuse at Houx 
in the north [May 13, 1940] with tank fire to support in- 
fantry, and drove a wedge between the French First and 
Ninth Armies. The same day, south at Sedan, hundreds of 
dive bombers blasted a bridgehead across the river for Gu- 
derian's tanks, which raced between the Ninth and Second 
Armies and crossed the Ardennes Canal before its bridges 
could be destroyed [May 14, 1940]. Other tank units under 
Reinhardt jumped the Meuse farther north at Montherme 
and cut up the whole defensive sector of Corap's isolated 
Ninth Army. There was a gap fifty miles wide in the French 
lines which List's infantry occupied [May 16, 1940] as it 
came forward at the rate of thirty miles a day with 45,000 
vehicles in its columns. The French committed their reserves 
all too slowly in a belated counterattack to unite their First 
and Second Armies. 

Meanwhile Nazi armored spearheads drove toward the 
English Channel in two columns, one up the valley of the 
Somme, the other along a northern ridge, both following 
good highways. In eleven days these tanks raced 220 miles 
through the enemy's rear to the English Channel [May 21, 
1940] . Motorized infantry followed the tanks to protect their 
southern flank, and Rundstedt's main infantry force marched 
up the panzer corridor which now divided the combined 
British and Belgian armies from the bewildered French. 

General Weygand, who replaced Gamelin in command 
[May 19, 1940], sought to reunite these armies by joint 
counterattacks from north and south upon the German cor- 
ridor. But in France the Nazis could not even be dislodged 

50 



from their bridgeheads on the Somme [May 29, 1940], and 
in Belgium the British were hard pressed on both flanks. So 
the French tried to improvise a defense in depth, the Wey- 
gand Line, with strongpoints where 75 mm. field guns were 
sited for point-blank fire against tanks. 

Evacuation of Dunkirk 

In Belgium the British Expeditionary Force could not 
hold a defensive triangle based on the Channel against 
Nazi tanks and planes. Belgians on the left flank abandoned 
Antwerp [May 18, 1940] and defensive lines were drawn 
back from the Dyle River to the Scheldt (Escaut). The 
British Cabinet ordered withdrawal southward to join the 
French armies, but the German corridor cut off this escape. 
Since counterattacks failed to close the gap, the British 
retreated west to the Lys River [May 21, 1940]. When the 
Channel ports of Boulogne and Calais fell into enemy hands, 
only Dunkirk was left for a base [May 22, 1940]. The Bel- 
gians were driven northwest to expose the flank joining the 
British at Ypres, and there were no reserves to cover it. In 
this plight the King of the Belgians surrendered his Army 
[May 27, 1940]. Unless the British were to be annihilated, 
they had no choice but to leave the continent of Europe. 

Then began the last retreat to the beaches around Dun- 
kirk [May 28, 1940], a race against time. The difficulty of 
this operation was increased by streams of civilian refugees 
who crowded the roads and became panic-stricken under 
the strafing of Stukas. The threats of German tanks at 
Nieuport to cut off the retreat hurried the withdrawal. R.A.F. 
fighters from England soon raised an umbrella over the 
beaches, and No. 11 Fighter Group shot down 603 German 
planes with a loss of but 130. In the dark hours of five 
nights [May 29-June 2, 1940], 224,585 British and 112,- 
546 French and Belgian soldiers were evacuated to England. 
The Royal Navy commanded their rescue, but hundreds of 
small boats which could run close in shore did the work. 
Thirty thousand British troops were lost in the whole cam- 
paign, and after six days of evacuation not a man was left 
on the beaches. Then the RAF gave up the skies to the Ger- 

51 



mans. The Battle of Flanders was lost, and the Nazis were 
free to swing their forces southward to destroy the French. 

Battle of France 

Only thirty-seven divisions remained on the Weygand 
Line to defend France, and the Germans needed but forty 
to crush them. ''The French front consisted," as Weygand 
later said, "of a line of troops without depth or organization." 
Bock's armies started the attack [June 5, 1940] in a sec- 
ondary sweep designed to close the French coast to British 
aid. An armored division crossed the Somme and quickly 
struck westward to encircle the French Tenth Army [June 
9, 1940]. Above Paris the Seventh was forced to retreat 
southeast to the Oise, which in turn required the Sixth on 
its right to fall back. The main German attack [June 9, 
1940] across the Oise east of Paris was made by infantry 
which established a bridgehead for tanks to fan out and 
push the defenders back to the Marne. The rapid develop- 
ment of these attacks disorganized the French armies. With 
their communications gone they lost all power to resist. The 
defenses of Paris were abandoned; it was declared an open 
city to escape bombardment, and was finally occupied by 
Nazis [June 12-14, 1940]. 

The Germans did not halt their swift and thorough pur- 
suit. While Leeb's armies made holding attacks in front of 
the Maginot Line, the main German forces attacked it from 
the rear, pushing forward to Belfort [June 17, 1940]. This 
envelopment, together with a frontal penetration from Col- 
mar, divided the French forces in the east and trapped them 
in two pockets behind the Maginot Line. Retreating columns 
in western France were overwhelmed by armored Nazi forces 
which fanned out to Cherbourg and Brest. French divisions 
in the center were pursued south of the Loire as their ranks 
melted away [June 25, 1940]. "Generals are commanding 
battalions," Premier Reynaud wrote President Roosevelt 
when Paris fell; many of these battalions fought doggedly 
to the last. There was no organized rear-guard action; for 
the moment France was stunned by the disaster. Soon, how- 
ever, bands of patriots began to wage guerrilla war and the 
Underground movement was born. In the African colonies 



were many Frenchmen who never admitted defeat and car- 
ried on the fight. 

Italy Enters the War 

"The hand that held the dagger has struck it into the 
back of its neighbor," was President Roosevelt's description 
of Italy's coming into the war [June 10, 1940]. Not until 
France was staggering to its fall did Mussolini leap to the 
kill. Then his Alpine troops had so much trouble penetrating 
a few miles into France that it was evident he wanted the 
spoils of victory without fighting for them. Upon the out- 
break of war in Poland, Italy had declared itself non-bel- 
ligerent, not neutral, for it was free to choose its role by a 
secret provision in the pact with Germany which pledged 
both countries to avoid war for three years (1939-1942). 
During these years Mussolini expected to force France by 
diplomacy to give up Tunisia, Corsica, Nice, and Savoy. 
Hitler called the game off by plunging into war. Until the 
fall of France the Italian peninsula served him as a loophole 
in the Allied blockade. Italy entered the war too late to get 
anything from France except demilitarized zones between 
the French and Italian border and between Libya and 
Tunisia. But the war was extended to the Mediterranean 
and Africa as the Italian Army and Navy joined the vic- 
torious Germans. Great Britain rather than France stood 
the brunt of the Axis attack southward. 

The French Surrender 

When the French armies were routed on the field of battle, 
the French Government lost the will to resist and surren- 
dered. It was a political as well as a military collapse. At 
Tours, where the French Cabinet sought refuge after leav- 
ing Paris, Premier Raynaud asked Churchill [June 11, 1940] 
to release France from a joint pledge never to seek separate 
peace except by mutual consent. Churchill refused, and the 
English Government declared for itself that the war would 
go on. Reynaud tried to buoy up his faint-hearted colleagues 
by an appeal to President Roosevelt [June 13, 1940] to send 
"clouds of war planes ... to crush the evil force that 
dominates Europe." The President promised aid "so long 

53 



as the Allied Governments continue to resist" [June 15, 
1940], but pointed out that only Congress could make mili- 
tary commitments. 

England finally consented [June 16, 1940] to France's 
making peace provided that the French Navy was ordered 
to British ports. Churchill urged that France should join 
with Britain to carry on the war from Africa in a political 
union with one war cabinet, associated parliaments, and com- 
mon citizenship, a pooling of resources, manpower, and col- 
onies which might have made the two nations one and given 
them the strength to oppose Hitler. The French Cabinet, 
however, voted thirteen to eleven for an armistice with Ger- 
many. Reynaud resigned and President Lebrun asked Mar- 
shal Petain to form a new cabinet. The old Marshal, a de- 
featist like General Weygand, at once sued Hitler for peace 
[June 17, 1940], 

In the railway carriage at Compiegne, where Marshal 
Foch granted Germany an armistice in 1918, Hitler had his 
revenge [June 21, 1940]. France was divided, and the rich 
industrial north, over three-fifths of the country, was occu- 
pied by the Nazis. The French were charged with the costs 
of occupation at the rate of twenty million marks, or eight 
million dollars a day, French prisoners of war remained in 
Germany, hostages of Hitler, and the French Navy was 
disarmed with the assurance that neither Germany nor Italy 
would use it themselves. 

Marshal Petain became Chief of State [June 12, 1940] 
over what was left of France, the unoccupied south; and a 
rump session of the Parliament voted him full power to make 
a new constitution. He abolished the political system of the 
Third Republic, established in 1871, suppressed all political 
parties and trade unions, and tried to wipe out the memory 
of the French Revolution of 1789, exhorting his country- 
men to take Work, Family, and Fatherland as their watch- 
words instead of Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity. If the 
government at Vichy was not Fascist, at least it must col- 
laborate with Fascism, for there was no longer any power 
left Frenchmen to resist Hitler. General Charles de Gaulle 
escaped to London and raised the Cross of Lorraine as a 

54 



standard around which Frenchmen in the colonies and Un- 
derground patriots in France could rally. 

IV. BATTLE OF BRITAIN 

Back in the dark days of Dunkirk, the British people had 
resolved to die on their feet rather than live on their knees. 
•'We shall defend our Island, whatever the cost may be," 
declared Prime Minister Churchill [June 4, 1940] . "We shall 
fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, 
we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in 
the hills; we shall never surrender, and even if, which I do 
not for a moment believe, this Island or a large part of it were 
subjugated and starving, then our Empire beyond the seas, 
armed and guarded by the British Fleet, would carry on the 
struggle, until, in God's good time, the New World, with all 
its power and might, steps forth to the rescue and liberation 
of the Old." Americans took comfort from this declaration 
that if worse came to worst, the Royal Navy would move to 
their side of the Atlantic, although they saw no need to rally 
to Churchill's summons to cross the ocean and free Europe. 

Why Hitler never put Churchill's brave words to the test 
when England was least prepared is a mystery. It was an 
opportunity which once lost was never to be recovered. Per- 
haps he expected England to surrender like France; possibly 
he had counted on annihilating the Allied forces at Dunkirk; 
certainly his timetable of conquest did not allow for imme- 
diate invasion. 

In any case Hitler prepared to conquer his last enemy, 
who, with the surrender of France, now stood alone. Only the 
Royal Navy and Air Force guarded Britain's shores. An army 
of nine divisions but none of their weapons had been saved 
at Dunkirk, and a month passed before they could be reor- 
ganized for the defense of the British Isles. To help arm this 
force anew, the United States sold Britain what weapons 
could be spared from the stock piles of the last war: old 
Enfield rifles, Browning machine guns, and 75-mm. field 
artillery. In all of Britain there were less than one hundred 
tanks. 

Against such arms it was apparent in the summer of 1940 
that Hitler could invade England. The divisions he had used 

55 



in Norway were trained to amphibious assault. He lacked 
sea power but he had planes to transport troops. From the in- 
land canals of Europe he brought over three thousand barges 
to the coastal ports between Rotterdam and Cherbourg, 
where they became the summer targets for English bombers. 
The Nazis built bases for their bombers in France and the 
Low Countries, and set out to win full command of the air 
and temporary command of the sea, to cover the crossing of 
their troops. This vain attempt to conquer the English skies 
was the Battle of Britain, the first battle that Hitler lost. It 
was an action traced by the white vapor trails which earth- 
bound people saw four and five miles up in the sky as hun- 
dreds of planes, often invisible, fought at the furious speed of 
five miles a minute. The battle area, limited by the range of 
Nazi fighters escorting their bombers, extended from Hull 
and the Humber across to Bristol and the Severn. Never had 
there been so great a struggle in the air to decide the fate 
of any land. 

The Battle of Britain fell into four phases. In the first two 
phases the Luftwaffe sought to secure the Channel, ground 
the RAF, and destroy its airfields in order to prepare the 
way for invasion. Since none of these objectives was attained, 
in the last two phases the Luftwaffe resorted to a desperate 
aerial blitz to destroy London, cripple English transport and 
supply, and paralyze the British will to fight on alone. 

Triumph of the Spitfire 

The battle began over the English Channel [August 8-18, 
1940]. Coastal towns and ships were bombed all through the 
summer, but mass attacks started with four hundred planes 
swooping down on a convoy [August 8, 1940]. Soon other 
attacks were directed at the coastal ports and airdromes from 
south of Brighton to Portland. Armored Hurricane and Spit- 
fire fighters took heavy toll of the unarmored Messerschmitts, 
coming in on their tails and shooting them down. The Hein- 
kel and Junkers bombers, slow and under-armed, blew up and 
fell like clay pigeons. Nazi losses mounted as the attack 
reached its first peak, 180 planes being shot down one day 
[August 15, 1940], 153 three days later, for a loss of only 

56 



56 British planes and 27 pilots. Altogether, in the first ten 
days the Germans lost 697 planes, the British 153. 

Even the Luftwaffe could not survive attrition at this rate. 
So Goering gave his airmen a brief rest, reorganized his 
squadrons, and in the second phase [August 24-September 
5, 1940] sent them after the stout British fighters and their 
airfields. Nazi bombers flew over a wider front with increased 
fighter protection; in one day as many as eight hundred 
planes sallied forth against the RAF [August 30, 1940]. But 
the airdromes in the Home Counties around London were 
too scattered, the pilots too tough, and warning too quick for 
the RAF to be grounded. Again the box score of aerial com- 
bat showed the Nazis to be heavy losers: 562 German to 219 
British planes, and from the latter 132 pilots parachuted to 
safety and took up other planes. Because Nazi bombers could 
not face the British fighters in daylight, they began to come 
over more frequently at night. 

Bombing of London 

In the third phase of the battle [September 6-October 5, 
1940], Goering concentrated his attack on London, nerve 
center of the British Empire, as if the RAF were out of the 
way and the British ready to be softened up for invasion. 
London was a political rather than a. military target; it was 
pounded in thirty-eight daylight raids to paralyze communi- 
cations and morale. Goering himself flew in command of this 
attack, for it was intended to be the knockout blow. London 
antiaircraft batteries had first opened fire on stray raiders a 
month before. Now the Nazi bombers came over day and 
night, alone in the dark, in waves of 20 to 250 when it was 
light, with as many fighters boxing in their flanks and tails, 
flying escort upstairs and down. Docks, railways, factories, 
gas and electric light plants, and thousands of homes were 
ruined. In September over one thousand tons of high ex- 
plosives, altogether some ten thousand bombs, fell on Lon- 
don, visiting more destruction than any city had ever en- 
dured. In three months 12,696 London civilians lost their 
lives. The Spitfires and Hurricanes ranged in three great 
semicircles around the battered British capital to inter- 
cept the best yellow-nosed planes of the Luftwaffe. Spit- 

57 



fires dashed into the high fighter screens, of Messerschmitts, 
while Hurricanes stampeded the Heinkel and Junkers bomb- 
ers below. 

In desperation the Nazis protected these bombers with 
more fighters until there were sometimes four Messerschmitts 
to guard one Heinkel. Yet in the first great daylight raid on 
the London docks [September 7, 1940] they left 103 of their 
350 planes in the smoke and flame which swept the Thames. 
A week later, when 500 planes raided London in two waves, 
coming before and after Sunday dinner, 185 never returned. 
On another raid [September 27, 1940], No. 1 1 Fighter Group 
of the RAF, which destroyed 442 enemy planes in this phase, 
brought down 99 Nazi craft with a loss of only 15 of its 
pilots. 

Churchill spoke their citation: "Never in the field of hu- 
man conflict was so much owed by so many to so few." No 
less credit was due their machines, the deadly Spitfires, and 
the controllers who plotted their paths, and the weary thou- 
sands of men and women who kept watch in Air Raid Pre- 
cautions, fought fires, and dug their neighbors out of the 
smoking rubble. They were all soldiers of the army, civilian 
and military, which saved Britain. 

Defeat of the Luftwaffe 

The last phase of the battle [October 6-31, 1940] was 
marked by the Luftwaffe's retreat to night raids on London, 
and later on other cities and towns. The bombing now was 
blind, carried on for the sake of terror and destruction. Large 
formations of bombers came over London at thirty thousand 
feet, and speedy Messerschmitts fitted up with bombs made 
hit-and-run raids. All these attacks failed, with losses too 
heavy for the Luftwaffe to bear. In day raids alone during 
the Battle of Britain the Nazis sacrificed 2,375 planes and 
their crews, while the British lost altogether only 375 pilots. 

Because of such losses, amounting to ten per cent of the 
planes engaged, the Luftwaffe lost the Battle of Britain. 
Operating [August 8-October 5, 1940] with a force estimat- 
ed at 1,500 bombers and 1,000 fighters, the Nazis made about 
22,000 sorties, an average of 400 a day, against a British 
force of some 800 fighters, each one flying several sorties a 

58 



day to compensate for inferior numbers. Thus at the height 
of the battle the Luftwaffe made 900 sorties in a single day 
[September 15, 1940], and the RAF flew only one less. Al- 
though the total German air strength was far greater than 
the British, it was actually much weaker in the decisive 
element — fighter planes. The four-cannon Hurricanes and 
six-gun Spitfires, outnumbered by the Messerschmitts, 
nevertheless outfought them two and three to one. 

Nazi bombers failed no less than their fighters. Unlike such 
British and American heavies as the Lancaster, Liberator, 
and Flying Fortress, they did not have the armor, fire power, 
and bomb capacity to undertake strategic bombing by them- 
selves. When British bombers began their offensive against 
Germany [May 30, 1942], they blasted Cologne in an hour 
and a half with three times the weight of high explosives 
dropped on London by the Luftwaffe during the worst month 
of the Battle of Britain, Want of efficient ground crews and 
of stockpiles of spare parts for repair robbed the Nazi bomb- 
ers of the staying power necessary to deliver a knockout blow. 
Goering's proud Luftwaffe was found to be only a tactical 
auxiliary to the Army, and air power no substitute for power 
on land. The Luftwaffe had its chance and suffered a decisive 
defeat in the Battle of Britain. Never again did the German 
command rely on air power alone to crush an enemy. 

Continued Bombing of Britain 

The bombing of Britain did not stop. It went on through 
the winter and into the summer of 1941, until the bulk of the 
Luftwaffe was transferred to the Russian front. Industrial 
cities in the Midlands and the north of England suffered from 
the sporadic night raids of one hundred to four hundred 
bombers. About four hundred Nazi planes dropped more 
bombs on Coventry in one night [N ovember 14, 1940] than 
any part of London ever received. Birmingham, Manchester, 
Liverpool, and the ports of Hull, Plymouth, and Bristol were 
repeatedly bombed in the spring of 1941. But of all English 
cities, London was struck most often. Incendiaries were first 
dropped in the City on a massive scale [December 29, 1940] 
when one hundred Nazi planes started fifteen hundred fires 
in a three-hour raid. Through 1940 over a million houses in 

59 



London were damaged. Up to the end of 1941 it was es- 
timated that the Nazis dropped 190,000 tons of bombs on all 
of Britain, killing 43,667 civilians and seriously wounding 
50,387, inflicting more casualties on the "home front" than 
British troops had then suffered in battle. 



11. THE UNITED STATES IN DANGER 

The fall of France in 1940 brought Nazi troops to the 
Atlantic coast of Europe, where they were to stay until 
American and British armies drove them back in 1944. The 
French Army, which had stood between Germany and the 
United States in the last war, was gone. For the first time 
since Napoleon the continent of Europe was dominated by 
one military power, and consequently the United States was 
in danger. Its safety in the nineteenth century, the freedom 
it enjoyed to expand its territory westward, keep out of 
European wars, and raise its standard of living to new heights 
of comfort and prosperity, had rested at bottom on the fact 
that no single power threatened it with the organized might 
and resources of Europe. When Germany and her allies 
fought to control Europe in the last war, the United States 
entered the struggle which had ended in German defeat. By 
the summer of 1940, however, Germany had conquered West- 
ern Europe, and the Germany of Hitler was a far stronger 
nation, much more dangerous and ambitious than the Ger- 
many of 1917. Only the British fleet and air force barred the 
way to the west. 

The swift and overwhelming success of the German armies 
aroused the American people from a complacent trust in their 
own security. To their earlier complacency, public opinion 
polls testified. In the summer of 1939 a majority of Ameri- 
cans did not anticipate any war in Europe. When asked what 
we probably would do if war broke out, one-third of the peo- 
ple thought we would remain neutral; one-fourth, that we 
would enter the war and send troops overseas; and almost 
one-half, that we would furnish supplies but not men. Most 
Americans, of course, sympathized with England and France 
rather than with Germany, and when war actually broke out, 

60 



they believed that these countries would defeat the Nazis. 
Half the Americans canvassed in polls of opinion thought at 
first that the war would not last over a year. If it appeared 
that England and France were to be beaten, however, almost 
half believed that we should declare war on Germany and 
send troops to aid the democratic nations. 

In short, before war broke out, we did not as a people 
think there would be any war; when war came, we expected 
it to be over soon, with France and England triumphant. In 
the unlikely event that they were not to win, we rather easily 
imagined that we ourselves would fight, and win victory. The 
natural optimism of the American people was reflected in 
their opinion, so far as it could be accurately registered by 
sample polls, and what they wished strongly colored what 
they thought. But the swift march of events woke them up 
with a shock. 

The conquest of France was the greatest lesson Hitler ever 
taught the American people. Before France fell, not half of us 
imagined that we would be personally affected by a German 
victory. The New World said of the Old, "It is their war." 
With the collapse of France, however, two-thirds of the 
American people realized that the triumph of the Nazis would 
affect their individual lives, and they grimly prepared for it. 
Although no longer confident that Britain would win the 
war, a majority believed that it was more important for the 
United States to stay out of war than to help Britain. If 
Germany won, they thought we could still carry on friendly 
diplomatic relations and trade with the Nazis. The immediate 
problem was to look to our own defenses. About three of 
every four Americans said that all able-bodied men should 
serve one year in the Army, that the National Guard should 
be called up for intensive training, and that production for 
defense should be increased. 

America Prepares 

With the evident support of an enlightened public opinion 
both the President and Congress heeded the pleas of the 
Army and Navy to improve our defenses. The American 
Navy, although second to none at the start of the war, had 
been kept for the most part in the Pacific Ocean to guard 

61 



against the danger of Japanese expansion. It was essentially 
a one-ocean Navy, but the alarming situation in Europe made 
it clear that protection was needed in two oceans, against 
Germany as well as Japan. The British Navy still held the 
Atlantic, but not securely against submarines and airplanes. 
If its ships were dispersed or destroyed, and its English bases 
lost in the Battle of Britain, a prospect that no one could 
discount in the summer of 1940, then we would be face to 
face with a triumphant Hitler. As extra insurance Congress 
passed the Two-Ocean Navy Bill [July 19, 1940], appropri- 
ating money to add some two hundred warships to our fleets. 
This was the greatest naval expansion ever authorized up to 
that time by any country. It promised to increase our combat 
tonnage by seventy per cent or 1,325,000 tons, and to give us 
a navy equally strong in the Pacific and the Atlantic, but not 
until 1943 or 1944. 

In the production of military armament the most startling 
increase was planned for airplanes. The United States Army 
Air Forces hardly deserved the name and had to be enor- 
mously expanded almost overnight. The Army was limited 
by law to a strength of 2.300 planes, the Navy to 1,000, and 
neither service was up to its authorized strength. In 1939 the 
American aircraft industry produced only 2,100 military 
planes, the bulk of which were for training; production had 
been doubled to reach even this small output, and in the ab- 
sence of American orders the industry had been enlarged by 
English and French purchases. Nevertheless, six days after 
the Nazis began their invasion of France, President Roosevelt 
sent a message to Congress [May 16, 1940] asking for the 
production of fifty thousand planes in one year. At that time 
nothing short of a miracle could have achieved the goal, but 
we surpassed that figure in 1943. With increasing American 
orders in 1940-41 the aircraft industry grew rapidly. Produc- 
tion soared from 561 military planes in July 1940, to 1,914 
fourteen months later. 

Essential to the manufacture of planes, tanks, ships, and 
ordnance, the blue prints for which were drawn in 1940, were 
the tools to make them. Almost unnoticed by the public, the 
manufacture of machine tools increased sharply. Normal 
production ran about 25,000 units a year, but in 1940 it 

62 



mounted to 100,000, the best guarantee of far greater 
industrial output in the next few years. In terms of dollars, 
however, the nation still saved on defense and spent for 
peacetime living. In 1940, articles manufactured for civilian 
use cost about twenty-four billion dollars, and those for de- 
fense only one and a half billions. But money was appro- 
priated and orders were being placed for the greatest war 
production ever known in the United States in times of 
peace. The defense program which got under way with the 
fall of France called for an expenditure of twenty-eight 
billion dollars, only twelve billions less than our entire 
national debt. This was the initial cost of building a navy 
and training an army to protect the United States against 
Hitler's forces. 

Mobilization by Selective Service 

The authorized strength of the Regular Army early in 1940 
was 227,000, and of the National Guard, 235,000, a total of 
half a million men, less than Poland or Belgium mustered 
against Germany. This small army was regarded as the initial 
protective force, according to the American military policy 
adopted after the last war in the National Defense Act of 
1920. It was expected that in any emergency there would be 
time to train a mass army behind the protective screen of the 
Regular Army and National Guard. But the collapse of the 
French Army left us no time in which to prepare as in the 
last war. For the defense of the Western Hemisphere, which 
we had to assume at once, the General Staff believed that 
three to four million men should be trained. An initial pro- 
tective force of half a million was no longer enough; it was 
imperative for the U. S. to begin mass mobilization in order 
to be safe. 

To start the necessary training, the War Department re- 
quested in May 1940, that the National Guard should be 
called to duty and "federalized" as part of the active army. 
Congress not only granted this request [August 27, 1940] 
but after a summer of debate passed the Selective Service Act 
\ September 16, 1940] to mobilize the manpower of the 
nation for military service. Sixteen million men between the 
ages of twenty-one and thirty-six were registered [October 

63 



16, 1940] by voluntary boards of their fellow citizens. The 
number of men to be called up for training each year was 
first set at nine hundred thousand, and their period of train- 
ing was limited to one year. Nine months later [June 30, 
1941] nearly a million and a half men, including the Regulars 
and National Guard, were serving in the Army. Their number 
was limited chiefly by the slower increase of officer personnel 
to train them and of supplies with which to equip them. It 
was significant that for the first time in its history the United 
States had adopted compulsory military training while the 
country was still at peace. The fact was a measure of the 
danger which the American people felt as a result of the fall 
of France and the sweep of Hitler's armies over Europe. 

"We are in the presence not of local or regional wars," 
declared the Secretary of State, Cordell Hull [October 26, 
1940], "but of an organized and determined movement for 
steadily expanding conquest. Against this drive for power no 
nation and no region is secure save as its inhabitants create 
for themselves means of defense so formidable that even the 
would-be conquerors will not dare to raise against them the 
hand of attack." 



12. THE AXIS ON THE OFFENSIVE 

Hitler's armies did not overrun all Europe in one year 
of war, but in that time the continent west of Russia fell 
under his sway. Nations which remained independent in 
name were nevertheless dependent on Hitler's will because 
they lacked either the strength or the resolution to oppose 
it. German military power overawed Fascist Italy, outflanked 
Sweden, and surrounded Switzerland. Governments friendly 
to Fascism ruled Spain, Rumania, Bulgaria, and Hungary. 
Yugoslavia, Greece, and Russia, the only European nations 
besides Great Britain which still resisted the New Order, 
soon felt the tramp of Nazi boots across their lands. 

The influence of Hitler extended far beyond Europe, for 
his military success was a most frightening recommendation. 
What he had done, democratic peoples were afraid could 
never be undone, and Fascists in other countries thought 

64 



they might do the same. The Nazis, according to one widely- 
read American author, were riding the ''wave of the future." 
A few thousand people in this country dressed themselves up 
in uniforms like those of Hitler's Brown Shirts, organized 
a Bund, and gave the Nazi salute; many more thousands of 
Americans expressed Fascist sentiments in the pattern set 
by the Ku Klux Klan, venting their spleen on Jews, Negroes, 
Catholics, and "furriners." In South America, Nazi agents 
plied their trade with governments and groups which dis- 
liked the United States and admired the mother-country of 
their language. Fascist Spain. In the Far East another mili- 
taristic country became the ally of Germany and Italy, ex- 
tending the Rome-Berlin Axis to Tokyo. 

Even after Hitler had lost the Battle of Britain, the power 
and influence of Fascism were terrifying. Capitalizing on 
this prestige, Hitler offered in a speech to divide the world 
with Britain, the United States, and Japan, choosing Europe, 
the Middle East, and most of Africa for the Axis. When 
neither Great Britain nor the United States took up this 
offer to share a world he did not yet possess, he set out to 
conquer it alone. To assure his domination of Europe, he 
first had to subdue the two great powers which had not 
yielded to his will, Great Britain and Russia. Britain was 
besieged with both airplanes and submarines. These arms 
enabled the Nazis to escape the limitations of ground troops 
and to reach out beyond continental Europe. 

I. BRITAIN BESIEGED 

The Battle of the Atlantic, as the war between German 
submarines and Allied ships came to be called in 1942, really 
began the first day war broke out between Great Britain 
and Germany. This struggle was crucial because the British 
Isles depended on Atlantic sea lanes for existence. The Royal 
Navy, starting in where it had left off in the last war, 
established a blockade of Germany, and the Germans like- 
wise resumed their undersea counterblockade with subma- 
rines. During 1939 and 1940 the British Admiralty reported 
the loss of 677 merchant ships, and a total loss, including 
Allied and neutral ships, of 4,525,228 tons. With an annual 

65 



shipbuilding capacity of 1,500,000 tons, Britain could not 
hope to replace vessels at this rate of destruction. 

The situation grew critical for England because, with the 
fall of France, Germany became an Atlantic power with 
greater undersea strength than the Royal Navy could handle. 
British coastal waters were protected by minefields and fly- 
ing-boat patrols, and trans-Atlantic ships were herded into 
convoys, which were first used to defeat the submarine in 
1917. The British did not have enough destroyers to escort 
convoys across the Atlantic and through the Mediterranean 
or around Africa. Furthermore, the French Navy, which had 
policed the Mediterranean, was out of the war. In this sea 
Germany had gained the advantage of assistance from the 
Italian Navy. Thus the Axis acquired offensive power in two 
seas which Britain could not control single-handed. 

American Aid 

The United States came to the aid of the British. Britain 
had lost ten destroyers at Dunkirk, and in the evacuation 
of troops seventy-five more were damaged and laid up for 
repairs, disabling almost half their destroyer fleet. By Ex- 
ecutive Agreement [September 3, 1940] the United States 
traded 50 four-stack, flush-deck destroyers, veterans of the 
last war, in exchange for 99-year leases of British bases in 
the West Indies, on Antigua, Jamaica, St. Lucia, the Ba- 
hamas, British Guiana, and Trinidad; in addition we re- 
ceived as gifts the right to bases on Newfoundland and 
Bermuda. By this deal Britain recruited her naval strength 
against Nazi submarines, and America came into possession 
of bases adequate to protect her Atlantic shores. 

U-Boat Campaign, 1941 

The German undersea drive against British shipping 
reached a new peak early in 1941. Losses for the year 
mounted to 3,708,000 tons, the heaviest toll being taken in 
the winter and spring months. In May, the worst month, the 
sinkings amounted to 658,000 tons. Although these losses 
never ran as high as in the last war, when 834,000 tons were 
sunk in April 1917, the future looked dark because of the 

66 



low rate of replacement and the more successful tactics of 
German submarine warfare. The combined shipbuilding pro- 
duction of British and American yards in the spring of 1941 
was only two million tons a year, little more than half the 
current losses. 

With a fleet of U-boats variously estimated at 180 to 400, 
oceanic submarines of over 1,000 tons and coastal '^minnows" 
of 250 tons, the Nazis perfected new and more efficient 
tactics. Their U-boats no longer scouted the seas half-blind 
and alone, as in the last war, but hunted in wolf-packs with 
aerial observers to spot convoys. U-boats trailed their quarry 
by day and lay in wait to make the kill at night. They at- 
tacked swiftly from the surface by night, combined their tor- 
pedo fire along the flanks of convoys, cut out stragglers, and 
made feints to divert escort warships. Against such tactics the 
British had little success at first. Only seventy-one U-boats 
were sunk from the beginning of the war to April 1941. Dur- 
ing all of 1941 the press estimated that twenty-three were 
sent to the bottom. While the British lost ships faster than 
they could replace them, the Germans did not lose as many 
U-boats as they were building. 

More American Aid 

In this crisis the United States again came to the aid of 
Britain. President Roosevelt put at the disposal of England 
the Axis ships seized in American ports [March 30, 1941]. 
The United States took over British shipping routes in the 
Pacific Ocean and in June released vessels for service in the 
Atlantic. U.S. Marines landed in Greenland [April 9, 1941], 
with Danish permission, to forestall Axis raiders, and later 
in Iceland [July 7, 1941] to protect the easternmost ap- 
proaches to American waters. The U.S. Navy established 
patrols [April 30, 1941] between the Atlantic coast and is- 
land outposts and, following the occupation of Iceland, along 
the western convoy routes. British naval forces were released 
to concentrate their strength in the dangerous waters be- 
tween Iceland and Eire. When a Nazi submarine fired on 
the Greer, a U. S. destroyer delivering mail to Iceland 
[September 4, 1941], American naval patrols were ordered 

67 



to "shoot on sight" any hostile craft. Nazi torpedoes dis- 
abled the destroyer Kearny [October 15, 1941] and sank 
the Reuben James [October 15, 1941] west of Iceland. Even 
before Pearl Harbor the Battle of the Atlantic cost American 
lives. 

The destruction of shipping abated sharply in the middle 
of 1941, and from July through October only 750,000 tons 
were sunk. This improvement was the result not only of 
American aid but of an increase in British flying patrols, 
corvettes, and bombing raids on submarine yards and bases. 
When the Nazis threw all their strength against Russia, 
moreover, they became weaker in the Atlantic. U-boats were 
concentrated in the Gulf of Finland and the Barents Sea, 
and the Luftwaffe shifted over most of its strength to the 
Russian front. 

II. BRITAIN DEFENDS THE MIDDLE EAST 

The war in the Middle East was a struggle for control of 
important waterways and land routes centering at the Isth- 
mus of Suez. The shortest shipping route from Europe to 
India runs through the Mediterranean and the Suez Canal, 
the life line of the British Empire. At the head of the Persian 
Gulf, flanking this route, are the richest oil fields outside 
America and the East Indies. The isthmus itself, a waste of 
sand and stone, is the land bridge between Africa and Asia. 
The tanks which dug their treads into the sand and soil of 
Libya, Egypt, Abyssinia, Syria, and Iraq were fighting for an 
area strategically vital since history dawned. Who won the 
Middle East, as Napoleon realized, might win the world. 

Italian Pincers in Africa 

Here the British, hard pressed at home, mustered an army 
of one hundred thousand Imperial troops. These men were 
drawn from Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and India, 
as well as from England, Scotland, and Wales. Early in the 
war they had only old planes and less than two hundred 
light tanks. Against these British forces Italy put in the 
Middle East two armies totaling half a million men with all 
their tanks, planes, and trucks. One army in Ethiopia under 
the Duke of Aosta was to advance upon Egypt from the 

68 



south, while the other under Marshal Rodolfo Graziani was 
to drive east from Libya. General Sir Archibald Wavell de- 
stroyed these armies, first in Libya and then in Ethiopia, in 
the course of six months. Yet this swift double play was only 
the beginning of three long years of war in the Middle East; 
the small British garrisons were robbed of men and planes to 
reinforce Greece, hold Crete, and conquer Syria, while Hitler 
sent the Afrika Korps across the Mediterranean under Field 
Marshal Erwin Rommel to renew the struggle which the 
Italians had almost lost. 

Wavell Defeats Graziani in Libya 

The war in Africa began when Graziani 's forces struck at 
Egypt [September 13, 1940] . The fall of France had secured 
their rear in Tunisia; England was fighting for its life in the 
Battle of Britain; and the Italians advanced safely into 
Egypt as far as Sidi Barrani. Here they sat down in rock- 
bound camps before reaching the main British line of resist- 
ance at the railhead of Mersa Matruh. The Italians feared the 
desert and hugged the coast, though the British Navy shelled 
the coastal positions. They were often sick and always home- 
sick. It was the greatest opportunity Italy had to increase her 
empire, for these troops might have raced east through the 
desert to Egypt, joining with the army in Ethiopia. 

But General Wavell caught the Italians in their African 
siesta when his brilliant tactician, General O'Connor, sur- 
prised them at Sidi Barrani [December 9, 1940]. British 
tanks raced along the Libyan coast, and in two months took 
El Solium, Bardia, Tobruk, Derna, and Bengasi. From a 
gasoline depot set up at El Meckili, deep in the desert south- 
west of Derna, a column of twenty-five tanks with motorized 
infantry crossed 150 miles of unmapped desert to cut off the 
Italians retiring from Bengasi. The British reached their 
objective scarcely two hours before the enemy. The Italian 
army was trapped. Over 133,000 prisoners were captured by 
the British Imperials, who lost only 604 men in their light- 
ning drive. They occupied Cyrenaica [February 8, 1941], 
eastern half of Libya, as far as El Agheila. 

The British owed their success to surprise, mobility, and 

69 



bold bluff. The Italians made many mistakes. Their intel- 
ligence was poor; their planes were destroyed on the ground; 
and Marshal Graziani made each coastal town a fortress, 
walled with guns, wire, and antitank ditches, behind which 
his troops were trapped by British infantry and tanks. Fixed 
forts scattered over the vast Libyan desert could not hold it 
against fast-moving tanks. The sands like the seas presented 
no obstacles to ships equipped to navigate them, and armored 
trucks or tanks ranged the desert with speed and surprise. 
With their Long-Range Desert Patrols, based on the Siwa 
Oasis, the British raided enemy garrisons and communica- 
tions across hundreds of miles of desert wastes and com- 
pelled the Italians and Germans to convoy all their supplies. 

Liberation of Ethiopia 

General Wavell's victory in Libya protected Egypt on the 
west and left him free to destroy the Italian army in Ethio- 
pia, though few men could be spared for this operation. 
Against Italian garrisons of some 200,000 troops in Eritrea, 
Somaliland, and Ethiopia, the British mustered about 30,000 
men. They depended on naval support along the coast, su- 
perior plane and tank arms in the interior, and an uprising 
of native tribes to subdue the Italian forces. The blitzkrieg 
and fifth column tactics of the Germans were turned against 
their Axis partner. 

The British attacked from three directions, converging 
toward Addis Ababa, inland capital of Ethiopia, as they ad- 
vanced over highways built by the Italians and cut the two 
railroads to the coast. In Eritrea, to the northeast, British 
Imperials captured the mountain fortress of Keren [March 
26, 1941] after a siege of seven weeks. In the southeast, 
amphibious forces landed at Berbera [March 26, 1941] and 
cut the railroad from Addis Ababa north ©f Harar. The main 
attack came from Kenya in the southwest whence armored 
forces took Addis Ababa [April 5,1941] after covering 1,725 
miles in fifty-three days, one of the fastest sustained ad- 
vances of the war. Under orders from Rome, the Duke of 
Aosta made a last stand to prevent British troops from rein- 

70 



forcing Libya. A month later all Italian resistance ended 
[May 19,1941]. 

Ethiopia, first of the Fascist conquests, was liberated; the 
Emperor, Haile Selassie, returned to his kingdom. Italy lost 
control of the Red Sea coast, and American Lend-Lease 
supplies could reach Egypt. 

Rommel's Advance to Egypt 

In Libya the British had been compelled to halt at El 
Agheila [February 8, 1941] because troops and planes were 
needed in Greece against the impending German invasion. 
While the British forces were depleted, the Axis was rein- 
forced by the arrival in March of the Afrika Korps. This 
corps comprised two highly trained armored divisions (the 
15th and 21st) each with eight thousand men and 135 tanks, 
and the 90th Light Infantry Division, which made history 
with brilliant tank forays under Field Marshal Erwin Rom- 
mel. Special equipment provided by the Tropical Institute 
at Hamburg included food, clothes, shelter, and medicines, 
scientifically prepared for troops fighting in the desert. To 
support the Afrika Korps and hold its supply lines there 
were seven Italian divisions, one of tanks and six of infantry. 

Rommel's superior force ran through the weak British 
defenses [March 24, 1941]^ manned by only two divisions, 
and drove them back into Egypt. One Australian division 
was left behind to hold the fortified harbor of Tobruk on the 
German supply line. Rommel contained Tobruk as he built 
up a deep triangular zone of defense, from Halfaya Pass to 
Sidi Omar and Bardia, in order to secure Libya. An effort 
to relieve Tobruk [June 15-17, 1941] was disastrous to the 
British tanks which were used piecemeal against Rommei's 
concentrated counterattacks. During a siege of eight months 
the "Rats of Tobruk" were supplied by the Navy and RAF 
despite heavy losses from enemy bombers. If the German 
invasion of Russia had not deprived Rommel of the rein- 
forcements he needed to continue his advance, Egypt might 
have fallen in 1941. In July the British took advantage of 
German preoccupation with Russia to build up a strong 
army under General Sir Claude Auchinleck, who followed 
Wavell in command of the Middle East. 

71 



Safeguarding Iraq 

Meanwhile disorders in Iraq [May 2, 1941], inspired by 
Nazis, threatened the oilfields and pipe line to Haifa on 
which the British Mediterranean Fleet depended for fuel. 
Iraq was bound by an alliance with England, made in 1930, 
to admit troops to guard these oil lines, and a small British 
force had landed [April 17-18, 1941] at Basra in the Per- 
sian Gulf to march on Bagdad. But Arab forces surrounded 
the western airfield of Habbaniya and seized the oil wells of 
Kirkuk and Mosul. Troops were flown from India to relieve 
the Habbaniya garrison, and other units destined for Egypt 
were diverted to Iraq. General Wavell finally crushed the 
revolt [June 1, 1941] by sending a force in armored cars 
four hundred miles across the desert from Palestine. Thus 
the British confirmed their treaty rights and secured their 
oil supply. For the Nazis it was a serious loss of prestige 
among the Moslems in the Middle East. 

French Civil War in Syria 

In the Mediterranean, Nazi ambitions to strike at Suez 
and move toward India led the Luftwaffe to export planes 
and technicians to the Vichy French mandate of Syria. This 
was a key position because it threatened Egypt and the 
Canal. When Germany persuaded the Vichy Government to 
provide bases in Syria, even the United States protested 
[May 15, June 5, 1941] that such collaboration in the French 
colonies menaced the peace and safety of the Western Hem- 
isphere and made France an instrument of aggression. 

To forestall the Nazis, a mixed British force supported by 
the Free French invaded Syria from Palestine and Iraq [June 
8, 1941]. They hoped to occupy the mandate without much 
bloodshed lest the Arabs be aroused and the French Gov- 
ernment provoked into handing its fleet over to Germany. 
Civil war broke out as Vichy troops fought the Free French, 
each regarding the other as traitorous to France. Damascus 
fell in two weeks [June 21, 1941] and the advance continued 
slowly for another three weeks before the Vichy French sued 
for an armistice [July 12, 1941]. British occupation of Iraq 
and Syria secured one flank of the Middle East and of the 
main highways to India. 

72 



British Advance and Retreat in Libya 

In Libya the British prepared another drive, the "Cru- 
sader" campaign, to relieve Tobruk. The famous Eighth 
Army came into existence with six divisions: the 7th and 
70th Armored; two infantry divisions from South Africa; 
one from New Zealand; and another from India. They had 
enough tanks and planes, thanks to American Lend-Lease, 
to destroy Rommel's Afrika Korps if the tanks were concen- 
trated and if the planes gave them tactical support. 

The British launched their offensive [November 17-18, 
1941] with a holding attack in the north, a diversion deep 
into the desert from Giarabub to Gialo, and a sweep south- 
ward around Axis positions to take the airfield at Sidi Rezegh. 
At first the British wasted their armored strength, dispers- 
ing three tank brigades, each of which Rommel defeated in 
detail with his massed armor [November 18-26, 1941]. 
Later, when the British concentrated their tanks at Sidi 
Rezegh, they won. But they could not pursue the Germans 
because the 50mm. and 75mm. guns of the Mark III and 
Mark IV tanks outranged the British and American light 
machines. 

With this qualitative superiority in tanks and extraordi- 
nary skill in using them both strategically and tactically, 
Rommel seized the initiative. With a force of one hundred 
tanks he cut up the British rear and boldly swept into Egypt 
[November 24-27, 1941]. In this crisis British armor was 
regrouped to stab at Rommel's extended lines. A New Zea- 
land division sped to the relief of Tobruk through a corridor 
opened up from the west by Lieutenant General B. C. Frey- 
berg. Rommel won in a dash for Tobruk himself. [November 
30-December 1, 1941]. But he had lost so many tanks and 
reserves that he had no force left to continue his offensive. 
He fell back [December 16-17, 1941] before a threatening 
British envelopment, broke it up with dive bombers, and 
withdrew his Italian infantry all the way to El Agheila. Here, 
reinforced by tanks, he twice surprised the British covering 
forces with reconnaissance raids northward which destroyed 
two of their tank brigades around Msus [December 28, 1941, 
and January 23, 1942]. The British abandoned Bengasi 
[January 28, 1942] to stabilize their defenses farther east, 

73 



planting minefields from Gazala south to Bir Hacheim. Both 
sides settled down to repair their losses. 

What saved the British in this disappointing campaign 
was the stand of the Tobruk garrison, the 25-pounder used 
as an antitank gun under cover of which their inferior tanks 
moved within range of the Nazis, and the swift mechanized 
patrols which destroyed enemy supply dumps. Yet the Brit- 
ish had not learned to use tanks with the speed, concentra- 
tion, and economy of which Rommel was now a past master. 
The "Desert Fox" still threatened Egypt and the Middle 
East. 

Lend-Lease Aid to the Middle East 

American supplies also helped to save the Middle East 
from the Axis in 1941. Lend-Lease began to supplement 
British purchases, and American supplies were a crucial fac- 
tor in maintaining the defenses of the Middle East. During 
the year 2,400 planes were sent abroad to British forces at 
home and in Egypt, of which less than one hundred went 
under Lend-Lease, the remainder being bought by the Brit- 
ish for cash. Over half the production of light tanks in April, 
May, and June for the U. S. Army, 280 in all, were hurried 
overseas by Lend-Lease to slow down Rommel's drive into 
Egypt. Before the end of the year a total of 951 light tanks 
and 13,000 trucks was exported to Egypt, of which 786 and 
4,000, respectively, went under Lend-Lease, the balance for 
cash purchase. With these machines General Auchinleck 
launched his winter offensive to roll Rommel back through 
Libya and with them held the Germans when the drive failed. 
Lend-Lease came too late to save Greece and Yugoslavia, 
but in time to help defend the Middle East. 

III. NAZI INVASION OF THE BALKANS 

Hitler conquered the small countries of the Balkans as he 
subdued the rest of Europe, by political and economic coer- 
cion of rulers who would yield and by war against nations 
which resisted. He always applied diplomatic pressure first, 
advertising the success of his armies in Poland, Norway, 
and France as proof of what happened to peoples who dis- 
obeyed his will. Military force he used only as a last resort. 

74 • 



Hungary, Rumania, and Bulgaria were gathered into the 
Axis camp without fighting; Yugoslavia and Greece were 
crushed for daring to remain independent. 

Hungary, Rumania, and Bulgaria Join the Axis 

The Nazis extended their rule over the Balkans in order 
to close this corner of Europe to their enemies and to obtain 
oil, foodstuffs, and manpower. Hitler's diplomacy divided the 
Balkans by favoring Hungary and Bulgaria at the expense 
of Rumania and Yugoslavia, former allies of France. Then 
the countries which yielded were reduced to the position of 
satellites and used as bases from which Yugoslavia and 
Greece were outflanked, invaded, and conquered. 

Hitler's first step toward control of the Balkan area was 
the Vienna Award [August 30, 1940] by which the Axis 
stripped Rumania of spoils from the last war, returning 
northern Transylvania to Hungary and the southern Do- 
brudja to Bulgaria. When Rumanians rioted in protest, King 
Carol abdicated the throne [September 3, 1940]. General 
Ion Antonescu, supported by the Iron Guard, his only polit- 
ical party, became Dictator, and Nazi troops marched in 
[September 14, 1940]. Rumania then joined the Axis [No- 
vember 23, 1940]. Hungary also entered the Rome-BerHn- 
Tokyo alliance, along with Slovakia, the rump state of 
Czechoslovakia [November 20, 24, 1940] ; Bulgaria was oc- 
cupied by German troops as its Premier signed on the dotted 
line of the Axis pact [March 1, 1941]. The stage was set for 
the partition of Yugoslavia and Greece. 

Mussolini's Defeat in Greece 

Italian troops were snowbound in Greece after a winter 
campaign in which they tried to carve the country up single- 
handed. Mussolini had attacked Greece not only to extend 
his empire but to secure other points from which he could 
threaten Egypt, the prize which his troops in Libya sought. 
The attack on Greece was launched from Albania [October 
27, 1940] with five columns pushing through the mountains 
toward the main railroad leading to Athens. In two weeks the 
Italians advanced as far as the River Acheron, south of 

75 



Yanina, but there Greek mountain troops beat them back 
into Albania. 

Heavy snowstorms in the mountains suspended the Greek 
counteroffensive and saved the ItaHan troops. The Greek 
mountain infantry, without tanks or antitank guns, lived on 
coarse bread and packed their supplies on mules. For ord- 
nance they depended chiefly on captured Italian arms, some 
taken by General Wavell in his Libyan advance, the rest 
seized by the Greeks themselves. Despite lack of equipment 
and air power, the Greek Army more than held its own. 
Italian troops hugged their winter quarters in the mountains 
of Greece and Albania until the Nazis came to their rescue. 

The Balkan Campaign 

In a swift campaign of three weeks [April 6-30, 1941] 
the Nazis overwhelmed Yugoslavia and Greece, the only Bal- 
kan countries yet unconquered, and added the southeastern 
corner of Europe to their continental fortress. They con- 
quered sixteen million Yugoslavs, ill-equipped, never fully 
mobilized, and divided among themselves by feuds of the 
Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes. Patriots rallied as the Poles had 
done, to defend their long frontiers, instead of concentrating 
in the mountains as the guerrillas later learned to do. The 
seven million Greeks were also conquered by Nazi planes 
and armor after the Italians had been fought off by the al- 
most weaponless Greek Army. 

From Egypt came a British Expeditionary Force of some 
74,000 men, under General (now Field Marshal) Sir Henry 
Maitland Wilson, to fight a delaying action, hold Greek air 
bases, and honor their pledge to protect Greece. Too small 
to save the Balkans, this expeditionary force was neverthe- 
less too large to be moved from Africa without seriously en- 
dangering Britain's position there. While the Royal Navy 
convoyed these troops to Greece, the Afrika Korps crossed 
the Mediterranean to start its drive from Libya under 
Rommel. 

To crush the Yugoslavs and Greeks, the Nazis assembled 
about thirty divisions, chiefly in Bulgaria, equipped with 
new light tanks suitable for mountain warfare, and two 
fleets of three thousand planes. Mountains did not stop the 

76 



German war machines, which made strategic penetrations 
through the passes. Armored units worked even closer to 
the infantry than in Poland or France, and dive bombers 
gave tactical support to ground troops. This blitzkrieg in the 
mountains repeated the successes of Poland and Norway. 

Nazis Conquer Yugoslavia 

From east of the Struma River in Bulgaria, three mechan- 
ized armies struck west through the mountain passes [April 
9, 1941 ] . The capture of Nish and Skoplje by the two north- 
ern forces divided the Yugoslavs, cut them off from their 
allies, and opened the Vardar River valley to Greece. The 
southern army advanced through the Strumitca Gap to the 
lower Vardar and turned southward to Salonika. These 
crucial penetrations decided the issue of the whole campaign 
within seventy- two hours after it was begun. 

Yugoslavia was conquered in eleven days [April 17, 1941]. 
Belgrade, the capital, although declared an open city, was 
devastated by bombers and captured by a pincers movement 
converging from the borders of Austria, Rumania, and Bul- 
garia [April 14, 1941]. From Belgrade the Germans dom- 
inated northern Yugoslavia; Skoplje was their center in the 
south. Italian forces met in the west at Ragusa to close the 
Adriatic coast to Allied intervention and to cut the Yugo- 
slavs off from any such escape as they had made in the 
last war. 

Nazis Overwhelm Greece 

In Greece the Nazi assault on the Metaxas Line, protect- 
ing Greece from attack through Bulgaria, was resisted for 
two days. But the enemy breakthrough in the Strumitca Gap 
to the west had compelled Yugoslav forces to withdraw and 
expose the Greek left flank. A panzer division raced through 
the Vardar Gap to Salonika [April 8, 1941], outflanking the 
Metaxas Line and isolating three Greek divisions. Defense 
now rested mainly on the British troops, because the bulk 
of the Greek Army held their old positions in Albania to 
contain the Italians. Two Nazi armored divisions pressed 
south through the Monastir Gap toward Fiorina, splitting 
the British and Greek forces. To avoid being outflanked the 

77 



British had to fall back to a highland defense anchored on 
the east at Mount Olympus. 

The Luftwaffe, which had been held in leash by stormy 
weather, attacked strongpoints, strafed retreating columns 
with dive bombers, cut up the British rear, and smashed the 
Athenian supply port at Piraeus. British fighter support had 
to cease when it was most desperately needed because for- 
ward airfields were lost to the advancing Germans. The su- 
perior German armor threatened to surround the British on 
both flanks and forced them to shorten lines by retreating 
across the plains of Thessaly. At Thermopylae the Adolf 
Hitler SS Motorized Division was halted, but it turned west- 
ward to cut off and capture the Greek army at Yanina. A 
day later [April 20, 1941] the Greek Government advised 
the British to evacuate: "You have done your best to save 
us. We are finished. But the war is not lost. Therefore save 
what you can of your Army to help to win elsewhere." 

Evacuation was no easy task for the British because they 
lacked the air cover of Dunkirk. The Luftwaffe dominated 
the skies, its planes hovering like vultures over troops with- 
drawing southward to the Peloponnesus. To protect their re- 
treat, Anzac units held a thirty-mile line from Thermopylae 
to the Gulf of Corinth against six enemy divisions. In the 
west the Hitler Division raced southward through Epirus, 
crossed into the Peloponnesus at Patras, and threatened the 
British rear. In the east, Nazi paratroopers seized the Corinth 
Canal only a few hours after General Wilson's headquarters 
had crossed over. Once the British troops reached Raftis, 
Navplion, and the southern beaches, a lucky series of moon- 
less nights [April 24-30, 1941] hid their evacuations from 
the Luftwaffe. Some 44,000 men were taken to Crete and 
Egypt with the loss of only two destroyers and four trans- 
ports. But in Greece the British alone had lost about 30,000 
Imperial troops. 

Nazi Occupation of Crete 

The world gasped when German airborne infantry from 
bases in Greece, 180 miles away, captured the island of 
Crete in ten days [May 20-30, 1941]. It was the first time 
in history that airborne troops without heavy weapons over- 

78 



came superior land and sea forces. Twice the British East 
Mediterranean Fleet destroyed Nazi convoys [May 21-22, 
1941], but hundreds of enemy land-based bombers and tor- 
pedo planes sank or damaged so many ships that the Fleet 
withdrew from Cretan waters. INIost of the 3,500 Nazi shock 
troops who dropped by parachute were killed, but nothing 
could stop the glider trains and troop-carrier planes once 
airfields had been seized for their landing. The British gar- 
rison under Lieutenant General Sir Bernard Freyber^ had 
abandoned most of its antiaircraft artillery in Greece. Hurri- 
cane fighters in Africa, 350 miles south, were too far away to 
give support. In a few days the Germans landed in Crete 
about 35,000 airborne troops. 

Maleme, strategic airfield in the northwest commanding 
the British base at Suda Bay, was surrounded by para- 
troopers and finally captured by airborne reinforcements 
[May 20-2-5, 1941]. Although garrisons at the other air- 
dromes, Retimo and Candia, stood their ground, they could 
not join forces because German parachutists cut their com- 
munications along the northern coastal road. Enemy rein- 
forcements soon threatened Candia, and the island was lost. 

The evacuation of Crete took three days [May 27-30, 
1941] and proved more difficult than Dunkirk or Greece. 
Troops beat their way to Skafia on the southern coast, hid 
by day in caves, and at night boarded destroyers which car- 
ried them to Alexandria under a rain of enemy bombs. Over 
half the British garrison of 27,000 men was saved. The Ger- 
mans suffered 17,000 casualties to win Crete, but the victory 
protected their shipping and bases in Greece, interfered with 
the British Mediterranean Fleet, and threatened Egypt, 
Suez, and the Middle East from the air. 

Though the battle was a tactical defeat for the British, 
the island had not fallen in two days as Germany hoped. 
It was expected that the Luftwaffe would fly from Crete 
to Syria, to dominate the Middle East with the connivance 
of the Vichy French. Syria could serve as base for attacks 
on Iraq, and Iran in the summer of 1941 and perhaps for a 
later advance to meet the Japanese in India. The failure of 
the Nazis to carry out this obvious strategy, which would 
have divided the British Empire, was in part due to the fight 

79 



Britain put up in Greece, Crete, and Africa. Every battle, 
even though a defeat, delayed the enemy's advance and re- 
duced his striking force. For the British, the Balkan cam- 
paign was a retreat to victory. 

rV. GERMANY ATTACKS RUSSIA 

On June 22, 1941, Nazi armies invaded the USSR (Union 
of Soviet Socialist Republics), first by air and a few hours 
later by land. The attack brought immediate aid to Britain, 
for the two strongest military powers in Europe were now at 
grips, and the war's strategic center of gravity would shift 
from Britain and the Mediterranean to Russia. Both Ger- 
many and Russia were organized for total war. After nearly 
two years of conquest, the Axis commanded the population 
and resources of fifteen European countries. The USSR had 
a population of 192,000,000, more than Germany and all her 
unwilling vassals combined, and the Soviet peoples were 
spread over one-sixth of the earth's surface, a continental 
territory so vast that even the Nazis must have doubted the 
possibility of conquering it. 

How Russia Prepared for Defense 

While Hitler was busy conquering Poland, Western Eu- 
rope, and the Balkans, the USSR prepared to resist him. The 
Russians pushed their frontier westward at every opportu- 
nity to gain a buffer zone of defense against invasion. Eastern 
Poland was annexed to the geographic frontier of the Bug 
River [September 17-29, 1939]. Bessarabia and northern 
Bukovina were taken back from Rumania [June 27, 1940]. 
The Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania were oc- 
cupied and incorporated in the Soviet Union [August 29, 
1940] . A war against Finland won defensive space for Lenin- 
grad and control of the Gulf of Finland. 

Russo-Finnish War 

TheSvinter war' against Finland improved the strategic de- 
fenses of the USSR. The Finnish border came within sixteen 
miles of Leningrad; Hango and other naval bases in the 
Gulf of Finland covered a seaway for invasion; and Petsamo 
in the far north was only sixty miles from Russia's ice-free 

80 



port of Murmansk. When Finland refused to yield control 
of these vital places, Russia went to war to get them. 

The Russians invaded Finland [November 30, 1939] with 
reserve troops, expecting little resistance, but their attack 
was halted fifty miles above Lake Ladoga. Fighting froze to 
a standstill in the cold winter with temperatures of seventy 
below zero. For a month the Red Air Force systematically 
bombed Finnish railroads, ports, and airdromes [January 
13, 1940]. Then massed howitzers blasted the reinforced 
concrete blockhouses of the Mannerheim Line on the Ka- 
relian Isthmus and threw its guns out of alignment [February 
11, 1940] . Voroshilov brought up his best infantry and tanks 
to storm the Viborg fort, bypass and then surround Koivisto, 
and smash Finnish resistance [March 2, 1940]. The Finns 
signed a treaty of peace which gave the USSR the frontier 
it wanted [March 12, 1940]. 

In the Russo-Finnish War the popular sympathies of 
France, England, and the United States went out to the 
smaller nation, for the USSR seemed at that time to stand 
closer to Germany than to tlie Allies. The United States dis- 
couraged the export of military supplies to Russia. France 
and England planned to send an army to Finland's aid, but 
Norway and Sweden would rxot permit the crossing of their 
borders [March 2, 1940]. 

The Finnish War was generally regarded as a proof of 
Russian military weakness; actually, it was a demonstration 
of strength. The USSR used about 600,000 troops against 
an equal number of Finns, supplied a 700-mile front over a 
single railroad, and broke through one of the greatest forti- 
fications in the world, the Mannerheim Line. As a result of 
the poor start Russia made in Finland, however, Stalin over- 
hauled the tactics, supply, and command of the Red Army, 
relieved Voroshilov of command, and hastened preparations 
to withstand a Nazi invasion. 

Why Germany Invaded Russia / -^ ^ ^ (d h 

Russia was alarmed by the sudden fall of France because 
it left Germany free to attack her in the east [June 26, 
1940]. Industry was converted entirely to war production 
and labor was speeded up. Soviet troops held maneuvers on 

81 



tiie border of East Prussia to the great alarm of Hitler, who 
was then fighting the Battle of Britain. He was dissatisfied 
with the scanty supplies obtained from Russia under the 
trade agreement of 1939, and frightened by the expansion of 
the Russian frontier westward. The showdown came in a 
conference between Hitler and Molotov in Berlin [Novem- 
ber 12, 1940] which revealed that Germany and Russia were 
no longer friendly enemies and that both wanted to be su- 
preme in the Balkans. When Germany swept through the 
Balkan region [March 3, 1941], Russia denounced Bulgaria's 
union with the Axis and signed a nonaggression pact with 
Yugoslavia [April 5, 1941], hoping to encourage her resist- 
ance against Nazi invasion. 

Soviet preparation for war reached its final stages. The 
quick triumph of Germany over the Balkan countries pushed 
Russia into signing a neutrality pact with Japan [April 13, 
1941] to secure her Siberian frontier and escape a war on 
two fronts. The best trained of all Russian generals, Gregory 
K. Zhukov, became Chief of Staff in February 1941 ; in May, 
Stalin publicly centralized all power in himself by taking the 
title of Premier. Russia was warned in the previous winter 
by both Churchill and Sumner Welles, then American Under 
Secretary of State, that Hitler plotted attack. 

There is no mystery about the reasons for the Nazi attack 
on Russia. Hitler had always looked on Russian Communism 
as his worst enemy and had long coveted the resources of the 
Soviet Union to make Germany self-sufficient. In Mein 
Kampj he wrote: "If the Urals, with their immeasurable 
treasure of raw materials, Siberia, with its rich forests, and 
the Ukraine, with its limitless grain fields, were to lie in 
Germany, this country under National Socialist leadership 
would swim in plenty." The dream of this wealth inspired 
Hitler to resume the old Drang nach Osten, the push to the 
east which the Kaiser had pursued before him. 

The Nazis had reached the conclusion that it was neces- 
sary as well as desirable to conquer Russia. "In my rear," 
explained Hitler [October 3, 1941], "there stood a State 
which was getting ready to proceed against me.'^ He be- 
lieved that Germany was not safe so long as another great 
power in Europe had the potential strength to defeat her. 

2>2 



Britain, the only other great European power which Hitler 
had not conquered, was already under, attack. From the sum- 
mer of 1940, when the USSR had frightened him with a 
passive second front and contained so many of his troops, he 
looked upon Russia as his enemy. His plan was to strike at 
Russia, whose power was stronger on land, before Britain 
could invade Europe, or American Lend-Lease supplies added 
too greatly to their strength. Hitler hoped to neutralize Bri- 
tain and America by presenting his attack on Russia as a 
crusade against Bolshevism. His political heir, Rudolph Hess, 
flew to Scotland on this mission [May 12, 1941]. It was the 
old dream of Munich, but Hitler found that his enemies 
could no longer be divided by the specter of Communism. 

The Nazi Invasion, 1941 

Until the Russian invasion the Nazis had never engaged 
in a campaign longer than two months, or fought on a front 
of over three hundred miles. In their attempt to conquer Rus- 
sia, however, they had to spread their forces along a broken 
front of 1,800 miles from the Arctic Ocean to the Black Sea. 
Instead of carrying off another blitzkrieg, they involved 
themselves in a grim war which sapped their strength for 
three long years. 

Nazi prospects were brightest when Hitler attacked Rus- 
sia. He massed so much manpower and fire power that he 
threatened the quick destruction of the Red armies. The 
Nazi forces were organized in three groups: the northern 
armies under Leeb to advance on Leningrad through the 
Baltic states ; the central armies of Bock to move on Moscow 
with the largest force; and the southern armies led by Rund- 
stedt to sweep through the Ukraine and take Kiev. Five air 
fleets totaling more than 3,200 planes and 20 armored divi- 
sions of 8,000 tanks were part of the 180 divisions mobilized 
by Hitler for the invasion of Russia. 

The Red Army had 158 infantry divisions ready to meet 
their attack. Red air strength was estimated at 6,000 combat 
planes, and of tanks there were 54 brigades, each with 200 
armored machines. Some 300 new divisions of reserves were 
mobilized within a half a year after the invasion began. The 

83 



potential power of the Red Army was seriously underesti- 
mated by the Nazis. 

The invasion of the Soviet Union fell into five phases, each 
an attempt at decisive victory which was never achieved. In 
the first phase [June 22-July 10, 1941] the German armies 
made rapid progress as tanks paced infantry, and motorized 
troops in the center drove forty miles a day into the heart of 
Russia. They overran Lithuania in the north, encircled Bialy- 
stok and Minsk in the center, and captured Lwow in the 
south. There was no "Battle of the Frontiers" in which the 
Russians could be destroyed like the Poles, for the Red ar- 
mies retreated to the Stalin Line, trading space for time. 

In the second phase [July 11- August 8, 1941] the invaders 
penetrated the deep defenses of the Stalin Line, advanced to 
Leningrad, besieged Odessa on the Black Sea, pushed to Kiev 
in the Ukraine, and fought the great battle of Smolensk. 
Again the main Russian forces escaped destruction, though 
the invaders pressed them hard and never relaxed the stra- 
tegical and tactical offensive. 

After Smolensk, in the third phase [August 9-September 
30, 1941], the weight of the Nazi attack shifted southeast 
to Kiev. The central and southern armies joined in the en- 
circlement of Budyenny's forces and exploited this victory 
rapidly through the Ukraine. In the north, however, the Ger- 
mans failed to break the defenses of Leningrad and settled 
down to a siege which lasted two years. In front of Smolensk 
the Nazis first gave ground in a tactical defensive against 
Timoshenko's counterattacks. Blitzkrieg could not be fought 
without pause in the vast spaces of Russia. 

The fourth phase [September 30-October 15, 1941] of 
the German invasion, part of the drive on Moscow, was the 
largest tactical operation ever planned by the Nazis. It took 
the form of two gigantic double envelopments of Vyazma 
and Bryansk to trap the forces defending Moscow. A battle 
more violent but less conclusive than Smolensk was the first 
result, and the struggle for Moscow followed. In the north 
the invaders spread eastward from the Valdai Hills to the 
headwaters of the Volga and from Velikie Luki to Rzhev ; in 
the south they drove deep into the Dnieper Bend. The situa- 
tion became critical along the whole front. 

84 



The fifth and final phase of the invasion fell into three 
stages, each a more furious battle than the last. First came 
the battering at the gates of Moscow [October 15-Novem- 
ber 1, 1941 ] , then a rush in the south to Rostov on the Don 
[November 1-21, 1941], and finally a series of smashing 
blows on three sides of Moscow [November 21-December 
7, 1941]. Hitler hailed the Battle of Moscow as a deathblow 
to the Red armies, but Russia reserves sprang to a counter- 
offensive while the Germans went into winter defense. The 
saving of Moscow doomed Nazi hopes of destroying the 
Soviet Union. The Red Army proved that it could stand 
every blow of the invaders, come back for more, and counter 
with heavier blows of its own. 

Race to Smolensk 

The Nazi invasion of Russia started with the main drive 
from Poland toward Moscow [June 22, 1941] . Marshal Bock 
sent the panzer armies of Hoth and Guderian racing ahead 
of his infantry in a double envelopment of Bialystok, which 
was surrounded from Grodno and Brest-Litovsk. As the in- 
fantry came forward to reduce these positions, motorized 
forces with armored spearheads swept on to envelop Minsk 
[June 30, 1941]. From these encirclements the Nazis claimed 
the capture of 323,898 prisoners, 7,615 armored vehicles, and 
6,633 planes [July 10, 1941] ; signifying, if true, the annihi- 
lation of a Russian army. The Russians in their forward po- 
sitions were not overcome for three weeks; they maintained 
an active defense, counterattacked the flanks of Nazi spear- 
heads, and fought stubborn delaying actions, using tanks and 
eight to twelve firing lines of infantry disposed in depth. 
Such were the aggressive tactics of the Russian retreat that 
the Nazis were halted for almost a week at the Berezina 
River [July 3-8, 1941]. 

But the power of the German drive appeared to be irre- 
sistible. Armored units lived off the country, abandoning 
their supply lines except for munitions and gasoline brought 
forward by air, and the infantry mopped up Russian forces 
left in the rear of the panzer advance. Nazi tanks crossed the 
Dnieper River and breached the Stalin Line [July 12, 1941], 
bypassing such strongpoints as Mogilev and Vitebsk, which 

85 



fell to infantry assaults, and reached the defenses of Smo- 
lensk, only 230 miles from Moscow. In this swift advance 
Bock's motorized infantry covered 360 miles from Bialystok 
to Smolensk in nine days, divisions leapfrogging those at rest 
to keep a force moving night and day. 

The great battle of Smolensk raged for three weeks [July 
20-August 9, 1941] in an arc extending from Nevel to Mogi- 
lev and along the road west to Orsha. From north and south 
the Russians counterattacked the German flanks and rear 
in an effort to encircle the invaders. These counterattacks 
lost cohesion under the combined assault of Nazi infantry 
in front and tanks in the rear. Russian communications were 
cut by a panzer thrust to Vyazma [July 27 , 1941]. The bat- 
tle ended with the Germans claiming the annihilation of an- 
other Russian army as they announced the capture of 310,- 
000 prisoners, 3,205 tanks, 3,120 guns, and 1,098 planes. In 
this battle of encirclement which lasted three weeks the Nazis 
had not destroyed all the "encircled" Russians. Many divi- 
sions withdrew; others took greater toll of the enemy than 
the enemy could take of them ; and all the defenders carried 
out their mission of slowing down the Nazi advance. As they 
evacuated Smolensk the Russians destroyed most of the city 
and left behind only 20,000 of the. 160,000 inhabitants, 
''scorching" the earth of both city and country in the wake 
of their retreat. 

At Smolensk German forces reorganized [August 10-15, 
1941], and some units went south to join others moving 
north from the Ukraine. They applied a pincer to twenty- 
eight Red infantry and armored divisions which had retired 
from Smolensk to Gomel. Although these units were envel- 
oped [August 19, 1941], many elements evacuated Gomel in 
a general Russian withdrawal all along the line to the east 
bank of the Dnieper [August 22, 1941]. 

Southern Advance in the Ukraine 

Rundstedt's southern armies made slow progress in a sec- 
ondary drive from southern Poland toward Kiev [June 22, 
1941]. Hungary entered the war [June 24, 1941] and joined 
the attack across her narrow Carpathian frontier. After arm- 
ored counterattacks failed to save the fortress of Lwow, the 

86 



Russians withdrew to the deep defenses of the Stalin Line 
[June 30, 1941]. The Germans bypassed Tarnopol, a strong- 
point which was later turned by Hungarian motorcycle 
troops, and swept forward to Zhitomir, bastion of the Stalin 
Line covering Kiev [July 9, 1941]. Here for almost a month 
German and Russian tanks fought a duel over Zhitomir 
[July 6-August 2, 1941], an action comparable to that at 
Smolensk in retarding the Nazi advance. Reichenau's panzer 
units meanwhile reached the Dnieper below Kiev [July 21, 
1941]. Far to the south the Rumanians advanced through 
Bessarabia and forded the Dniester; the Hungarians con- 
nected the Rumanian left flank and the German right [July 
2-19, 1941]. 

Zhitomir fell, and Kleist's panzer army swept south to 
join Rumanian troops who had now crossed the Bug in an 
encirclement of three Russian armies around Uman. This 
battle was another Russian disaster, according to the Ger- 
mans, who claimed the capture of 103,000 prisoners, but the 
bulk of the Russian forces retired across the Dnieper River 
[August 1-8, 1941]. Plunging deep into the Dnieper Bend, 
the Germans took up the pursuit, occupying Nikolaev on the 
Black Sea after its naval base had been destroyed. As the 
Germans reached Cherkassy and the Hungarians advanced 
to Kremenchug [August 26-September 6, 1941], both key 
points on the Dnieper, the Russians evacuated Nikopol and 
Dniepropetrovsk [August 26, 1941], blowing up the largest 
power plant and dam in Europe. One Rumanian army laid 
siege to Odessa [August 31, 1941]; another pushed ahead 
to capture Perekop and invade the Crimea [September 17, 
1941]. Except for Kiev and Odessa, the Ukraine was in Nazi 
hands. 

Battle of Kiev 

Although Reichenau's armored spearheads had reached 
Kiev [July 21, 1941] one month after the invasion began, 
the Nazis were held up within sight of the city for two 
months, a crucial delay in their timetable of conquest. Red 
artillery commanded the crossing of the Irpen from wooded 
heights, and westward along the Pripet Marshes the infan- 
try harassed the extended northern flank of the invaders. 

87 



East of Kiev, Budyenny massed 750,000 Russian troops for 
a counteroffensive. 

The Nazis planned to destroy the Red forces and take the 
city by encirclement. This maneuver was conceived on a 
scale so great that it required armies of the south and center 
to join hands; they fought the battles of Uman and Gomel 
as they moved toward each other. From the center Welch's 
Second Army, which had been kept in reserve during the 
struggle at Smolensk, advanced south to meet Stlilpnagel's 
Seventeenth Army coming north [August 26, 1941]. Mean- 
while the panzer armies of Guderian and Kleist swept east 
to form the outer arms of the double envelopment. The trap 
for the Russian reserves was set at Lubny, and Reichenau's 
Sixth Army sprung the trap by attacking Kiev from the West 
[September 14, 1941]. 

The Russians withdrew from the city, consolidated all 
their forces in a hollow square with hedgehog defenses, and 
launched furious counterattacks to break the encirclement. 
The Germans struck them from all sides, cutting armies into 
corps and corps into divisions, and using two air fleets to 
disrupt communications and provide quick reconnaissance. 
Russian units escaping east toward Kharkov were caught by 
Hungarian and Italian troops whom Hitler had brought into 
the line. Budyenny's southern armies were decisively de- 
feated [September 26, 1941]. The Nazis claimed the capture 
of 675,000 prisoners. Kiev was taken and the whole Ukraine 
down to the Dnieper Bend lay open to the invaders. 

Meanwhile the Russians challenged the enemy with a 
counteroffensive on the central front [September 5-27, 
1941] to divert his strength from Kiev and save Moscow 
from the main German forces. With fifty divisions Timo- 
shenko pushed west almost to Smolensk [September 14, 
1941], making the Nazis yield ground for the first time dur- 
ing the invasion. A pincers attack on Smolensk soon ex- 
hausted itself [September 27-29, 1941], without disturbing 
the German preparations for resuming their offensive. Mos- 
cow was safe for the moment, but the reserves at Kiev had 
been lost, and German forces swung north from the Ukraine 
to join the attack on the Soviet capital. 

88 



Southern Advance to Rostov 

While Bock's armies fought in vain to take Moscow, 
Rundstedt's southern forces advanced into the Crimea and 
the Donbas (Donets Basin), taking Kharkov, Belgorod, 
Kursk, Odessa, Stalino, Kerch and Rostov on the Don. 
Kharkov a city of 840,000 people, an industrial center like 
Pittsburgh, was defended by six lines of pillboxes which the 
Nazis penetrated with special combat teams using flame- 
throwers and dive bombers [October 23-24, 1941]. Kursk 
and Belgorod, rail junctions above Kharkov on the main 
line from Moscow to the Crimea, were outflanked [October 
24-November 1, 1941]. The Nazis organized the upper 
Donets for winter defense. 

Farther south, however, they pushed beyond the Dnieper 
Bend into the Donets Basin. The left wing of Manstein's 
forces circled toward Rostov and the right spread over the 
Crimea [October 15-16, 1941]. Their advance cut off 
Odessa. A Russian army besieged there by Rumanian troops 
secretly evacuated the garrison and crossed the Black Sea to 
Caucasia after destroying all the shipyards and factories of 
Odessa. Manstein's forces entered the Crimea by storming 
five lines of concrete fortifications on the narrow isthmus be- 
low Perekop [October 29, 1941]. Then they fanned out south 
and east, took the capital of Simferopol [N ovember 13, 
1941], contained the naval fortress of Sevastopol [December 
7 , 1941] , and bottled up a Red army in the Kerch Peninsula. 
Kerch, guarding the exit from the Sea of Azov and the pas- 
sage across the strait into the Caucasus, was reduced by 
siege artillery. In the Crimea only Sevastopol was left to the 
Russians. 

While Manstein's right wing swept the northern coast of 
the Black Sea, his left wing trapped Russian reserves be- 
tween Perekop and Berdyansk on the shores of the Azov 
Sea. Kleist's tanks cut off their retreat by racing northeast 
toward Stalino. The fall of this industrial city threatened 
Rostov [October 20, 1941]. Instead of defending Rostov, 
Timoshenko withdrew most of his troops from the city and 
organized a counteroffensive in the Donbas on a broader 

89 



front. The Nazis took Rostov but they could not keep it 
[November 21, 1941]. 

Timoshenko unleashed a powerful counteroffensive [No- 
vember 24, 1941] on a 120-mile front, in which his three 
armies not only recaptured Rostov but also relieved Moscow. 
As far north as Kharkov one Red army struck the Nazis; 
another descended on Rostov from the Donets; and a third, 
organized in Caucasia from troops who had evacuated Odessa, 
attacked Rostov directly across the Don [November 28-29, 
1941 ] . The Nazis retreated over one hundred miles to avoid 
encirclement and could not rally to halt the Red drive until 
they were west of Taganrog [December 3, 1941]. For the 
first time in the war Hitler had met an enemy who counter- 
attacked in strength and robbed him of his conquests. Al- 
though the Russians had lost the bread basket of the Ukraine 
and the war industries of the Donbas, they had evacuated 
heavy machinery and skilled workers to the Urals, destroyed 
whatever they could not take with them, and literally 
scorched the earth as they retreated. The Nazis conquered 
little but the land, thousands of square miles of it, and the 
sudden counteroffensive out of Rostov had shown that even 
these conquests were as insecure as they were barren. 

Northern Advance to Leningrad 

In the meantime, Leeb's armies in the north made the 
third great drive of the invasion [June 22, 1941], sweeping 
up through the Baltic states from East Prussia to Leningrad. 
At the start they overran Lithuania and Latvia without much 
opposition, and reached Dvinsk [June 26, 1941] after ad- 
vancing a distance of 175 miles in five days. Occupation of 
Riga [June 29, 1941] gave them a large supply port on the 
Baltic Sea. Through the summer the Nazi left wing under 
Kiichler reached the Gulf of Finland, splitting the Russian 
forces west of Lake Peipus and driving them into Tallinn, 
which was finally reduced by siege and assault [August 29, 
1941]. The right wing under Busch advanced northeast to 
Lake Ilmen, taking Polotsk, Nevel, Velikie Luki, Kholm, and 
closing in on Leningrad [August 21, 1941]. 

In the heavily wooded marshlands south of the city, the 
defenders checked the enemy from a maze of bunkers and 

90 



tank traps. Unable to hold these positions, they were pushed 
back to the Valdai Hills in a great arc from Tallinn to Velikie 
Luki, and finally contained within the fortifications of Lenin- 
grad. Beginning the assault on the city [September 4, 1941] 
with a tremendous artillery duel, the Germans captured 
Krasnoye Selo, stormed two hills, and claimed to have pene- 
trated the inner line of forts. They crossed the Volkhov 
River and partially encircled the city [October 21-Novem- 
ber 8, 1941], only to be stalemated. Leningrad held, though 
for two years the Nazis shelled the beleaguered city and 
waited for its starving inhabitants to surrender. 

Four days after the German invasion began, Finland en- 
tered the war against Russia [June 26, 1941] to regain the 
territory lost in 1940. Mannerheim's armies attacked south- 
east toward Leningrad, gradually reconquered the lost 
ground, and established a blockade of the city along the Svir 
River. The chief accomplishment of these Finnish troops was 
to immobilize Soviet forces. In the far north fourteen Fin- 
nish and seven German divisions under Falkenhorst suc- 
ceeded in cutting the railroad to Murmansk, but were unable 
to take the city. This vital ice-free port was kept open for 
supplies from America and Britain. 

But no Lend-Lease materiel was to be shipped to Russia 
until an accord had been worked out [October 1, 1941] by 
an Anglo-American mission to Moscow, and ratified by Presi- 
dent Roosevelt and Premier Stalin [November 4, 1941]. 
Some planes and tanks arrived from England, but never 
enough to replace those that were lost. The Russians ad- 
mitted that in the first month and a half of the Nazi inva- 
sion, they had lost seven thousand guns, five thousand tanks, 
and four thousand planes — more tanks than they would re- 
ceive by Lend-Lease in the next three years and nearly half 
as many planes. In the fall of 1941 their situation appeared 
desperate. 

Battle of Moscow 

After the encirclement of Kiev the armies of Bock turned 
against Moscow in the greatest offensive of the invasion. 
The best troops of the USRR were concentrated before the 
Soviet capital, the focal center for all the main highways and 

91 



railroads of Russia. To Hitler its capture was necessary for 
political as well as military victory. 

If Moscow was to be taken, the defending armies must be 
driven off or destroyed. For ten weeks the struggle raged 
[October 1-December 5, 1941] marked by the heaviest 
antitank battle of the war. The Red Army, attacked by five 
panzer armies, each with a thousand tanks, met the assault 
by massing guns of every type to support its infantry. A vast 
network of antitank ditches and trenches, strengthened with 
pillboxes and minefields, perfected the defense in depth. The 
total strength of Moscow, civilian as well as military, faced 
the invaders. Trained soldiers and the people of the city 
fought side by side. Battalions of workmen, young and old, 
untrained and almost unarmed, filled the line at Tula; divi- 
sions of volunteers marched out of Moscow to throw them- 
selves at the enemy tanks. As week after week of fighting 
went by, Russian manpower proved stronger than German 
fire power. The Nazi machine lost momentum, stopped, and 
finally rolled back. The Russians had saved Moscow and 
won a defensive victory which put an end to the Nazi in- 
vasion of 1941. The victory came after a series of defeats. 
Before the Germans reached Moscow they had to drive 
through Russian lines, splitting them apart and forcing them 
to a last stand before the city. The great offensive began with 
assaults on Bryansk and Vyazma. 

Encirclements of Bryansk and Vyazma 

The first objective of the Nazi drive toward Moscow was 
to break the armies under Timoshenko which had moved for- 
ward in their counterattacks on Smolensk as far as Vyazma 
and Bryansk. To annihilate these Red forces the Nazis 
planned the most complex operation of the Russian war, two 
gigantic double envelopments of both wings, with two sec- 
ondary envelopments, all to be accomplished in rapid se- 
quence before the defenders were aware of the threat. These 
maneuvers started with Hitler's order to his troops [October 
1-2, 1941]: "Today is the beginning of the last great de- 
cisive battle . . . which . . . will annihilate this enemy." 

The battle began with the sweep of Guderian's tank army 
from the Kiev front northeast to Orel [September 30-Octo- 

92 



ber 3, 1941]. The German capture of this rail junction, 
seventy miles east of Bryansk, divided the armies in central 
Russia from those in the south and threatened to cut off 
retreat from Bryansk. From the north Hoppner's tanks rolled 
south to Gzhatsk between Moscow and Vyazma [October 10, 
1941 ] . These armored arcs drawn by Guderian and Hoppner 
were the outer arms of encirclement. In the center Kluge's 
infantry, with .the panzer armies of Reinhardt and Hoth, 
drove forty miles into the Russian rear, divided, and then 
circled the flanks north and south [October 2-6, 1941]. The 
Germans boasted that the Red armies at Bryansk and 
Vyazma were split apart like an apple and each half seized 
and crushed in the armored jaws of the panzers. The circum- 
ference of each encirclement, however, was over 124 miles, 
too great an area to be mopped up quickly. The Russians 
adopted a hedgehog defense and launched ferocious counter- 
attacks to break out. After nearly three weeks of continuous 
fighting the Nazis claimed the annihiliation of eight armies 
of defenders with the capture of 648,196 prisoners. But the 
Russians had abandoned Bryansk and Vyazma several days 
before [October 12, 13, 1941], and while many divisions 
were lost, many more fell back to form an unbroken front 
before Moscow. The envelopments of Bryansk and Vyazma, 
chiefly the work of Kluge's army, were maneuvers prelim- 
inary to the assault on the Moscow front. 

Advance on Moscow 

For the main drive to the city Field Marshal Bock had 
two army groups; the Seventh, on a line about forty-five 
miles north of the Smolensk-Moscow highway; and the 
Fourth under Marshal Kluge along a line some sixty-five 
miles in the south. It was estimated that these forces con- 
sisted of thirty-three infantry divisions, comprising half a 
million men, thirteen panzer divisions, each with about four 
hundred tanks, and five motorized divisions. They jumped 
off along a line running from Yartsevo to Roslavl, about two 
hundred miles from Moscow [October 3, 1941]. Within three 
weeks they had smashed forward until their most advanced 
elements were at Mozhaisk, only sixty-five miles short of 
the city. This drive was an attempt to encircle the whole 

93 



central front in an arc from Kalinin through Rzhev to 
Kaluga. The crisis came when Nazi tanks, followed by mo- 
torized infantry, broke through the center to Mozhaisk 
[October 15, 1941], Russian counterattacks threw them back 
fifteen miles beyond Borodino but lacked the strength to 
hold them, so the Nazis recovered Mozhaisk [October 16, 
1941] and swept southeast to Maloyaroslavets. The outer 
defenses of Moscow were dented. 

Stalin gave the order [October 19, 1941]: "Moscow will 
be defended to the last." He declared a state of siege, charged 
Marshal Zhukov with the defense, made Marshal Shaposhni- 
kov Chief of Staff, sent Timoshenko south to defend Rostov, 
and Voroshilov and Budyenny to the rear to organize new 
armies. Trained reserves, including divisions from the Urals 
and Siberia, were arriving in the birch forests behind Mos- 
cow, but they were not flung prematurely into battle. In- 
stead, the citilfens of Moscow, even those who had no mili- 
tary training, were called to volunteer, and four Communist 
divisions went into action, without any weapons heavier than 
machine guns, while other citizen divisions, with women 
in their ranks, dug trenches and tank ditches. The improvised 
army slowed down the Nazis but could not stop the advance. 
In the last ten days of October the enemy made slow prog- 
ress, pushing ten miles beyond Mozhaisk in the center, twen- 
ty miles toward Tula in the south, and halting at Rzhev 
before the fortified northern bank of the Volga. 

The Assault 

Having failed to encircle the whole central front at Mos- 
cow, Marshal Bock reorganized his forces for a concentrated 
envelopment of the city proper. He kept the bulk of his 
infantry with two tank divisions in the center, and strength- 
ened his northern arm with seven tank divisions, three in- 
fantry divisions, and two motorized divisions. To his south- 
ern arm he gave speed and mobility, with four tank and 
two motorized divisions, reinforced by one infantry division. 
His plan was to use most of his infantry to hold the center 
under pressure while three columns from the north and four 
from the south encircled the city, the tanks to meet near 
Orekhovo-Zuevo, fifty miles in the rear. During the two 

94 



weeks Bock spent in preparing this assault, Marshal Zhukov 
brought some of his trained reserves into line. The Russian 
forces consisted of seven armies and two cavalry corps con- 
centrated on a front of two hundred miles. Red tank forces 
had been so heavy that units of 360 tanks were now reduced 
to brigades of 96 or even 60. 

In this final assault [November 16-December 5, 1941] the 
Germans in the north took Klin on the Moscow-Leningrad 
highway, pushed twenty-five miles east to Dmitrov, broke 
through from Rzhev to Volokolamsk, and came to within 
twenty-five miles of Moscow at Krasnaya Polyana. In the 
south two Nazi columns were stopped at Serpukhov on the 
Moscow-Tula road and at the Nara River. The whole popu- 
lation of Tula held the town by taking to trenches in sup- 
port of Siberian divisions. Guderian bypassed them with 
three tank and two infantry divisions, swept forward to 
Kashira, turned northwest in the rear of Tula and covered 
it with fire from all sides. The Russians here fell back, re- 
grouped their forces, adding reserves, and struck at Gu- 
derian's exposed flank [December 1-4, 1941]. In the center 
the crisis came when the Germans tried to envelop the de- 
fenders' flanks on the Smolensk-Moscow road; they suc- 
ceeded in breaking through in the south but were repulsed 
by reserves in the north, and this smaller envelopment col- 
lapsed. 

After the first fury of the assault was spent, Marshal 
Zhukov moved from passive to active defense, committed his 
strategic reserves to prevent encirclement of the flanks north 
and south of Moscow, and launched a counteroffensive on 
all sectors against the dangerously extended enemy. [Decem- 
ber 6, 1941]. The German lines had been flung eastward in 
two great arms, curving to inclose Moscow. But the grasping 
hands never met. In the rear of the city, a distance of 140 
miles separated the Nazi forces. Heavy snow covered the 
roads around Moscow, the temperature fell below zero, tank 
engines stalled as the lubricating oil failed, and the Luftwaffe 
was grounded. The Russians with skis on their planes and 
stoves to warm the oil for tanks were better equipped for 
winter fighting, and consequently gained superiority over 
the Germans in air power, armor, and fire power. The swift 

95 



Russian counteroffensive consisted of a series of small 
punches planned on a scale so great that the enemy had no 
chance to recover. One night a Red force knocked out a Nazi 
battalion, the next day partisans in the rear cut off a divi- 
sion's supply train, and always the Russians pressed the 
flanks of the retreating Germans. Guderian was beaten back 
in the south from Tula, and in the north Klin and Kalinin 
were retrieved. 

Moscow was safe; Leningrad held out; and only in the 
south of Russia did the Nazi invasion make headway again. 
In the Battle of Moscow the Germans were superior to the 
Russians in maneuver, mobility, and armament. Their tanks, 
two and a half times as many as the Russians had, failed 
to take Moscow. The Red Army held the city and won the 
battle by saving their reserves until the enemy was exhausted 
and then hurling them at his exposed flanks. These tactics 
marked the opening of the first Red Army winter offensive. 



13. AMERICA THE ARSENAL OF DEMOCRACY: 
LEND-LEASE 

Although the United States was technically at peace in 
the fall of 1940, busily preparing its own defenses while 
Great Britain was fighting for its life, the shadows of war 
spread across America from both the Pacific and the At- 
lantic. The sweep of Hitler's forces through Europe threat- 
ened this country from the east, as Japan's joining the Axis 
threatened it from the west. For the first time in its history 
the United States was confronted by the menace of war on 
two fronts. 

The Rome-Berlin Axis was extended to Tokyo when Japan 
signed the Pact of Berlin and became partner to a military 
alliance directed against the United States [September 27, 
1940]. In this treaty Japan recognized "the leadership of 
Germany and Italy in the establishment of a new order in 
Europe." On their side, Germany and Italy gave equal rec- 
ognition to "the leadership of Japan in the establishment of 
a new order in Greater East Asia." The Fascist powers were 
thus united for the conquest of Europe and Asia. The most 

96 



significant article in their treaty was an undertaking "to as- 
sist one another with all political, economic, and military 
means if one of the three Contracting Powers is attacked by 
a Power at present not involved in the European War or in 
the Chinese- Japanese conflict." This could refer only to the 
United States, which was to be neutralized and isolated while 
the Fascist Powers won the war. As Secretary Hull described 
it, "If you stepped on the tail of one of them, the other two 
would holler." 

The United States stepped on the tail of the Nazis in order 
to relieve the shortage of supplies from which Great Britain 
was beginning to suffer. All during the summer and fall of 
1940 it was apparent that Britain would soon be embarrassed 
for want of materiel with which to defend its home islands 
and the Middle East. Not only did British production dimin- 
ish under the persistent German bombing of towns and fac- 
tories, but American production was taxed by the demands 
of our own defense program. Only 2,100 of the 23,000 planes 
which the British had ordered or planned to obtain in the 
United States were delivered by the end of 1940. Worst of 
all, British purchasing power was nearly exhausted, for they 
could not offer goods or services to compensate for what they 
needed from us, and of private stockholdings in American 
companies they had already sold a third of a billion dollars. 
Loans of money might have been advanced; but it was war 
goods they wanted, and Americans still remembered that 
what they had lent their allies in the last war had not been 
repaid. 

In this crisis, which threatened to leave the United States 
to face the Axis alone on two fronts if Britain collapsed, the 
United States Treasury proposed to lend or lease weapons 
of war to nations fighting the Axis. From this proposal Presi- 
dent Roosevelt eliminated the dollar sign, as he said, by 
balancing the defense of the United States against the casn 
value of weapons and supplies. Over the radio he told the 
American people that if Britain collapsed, "all of us in the 
Americas would be living at the point of a gun — a gun loaded 
with explosive bullets, economic as well as military." To pre- 
vent the triumph of the Axis and to keep the war from our 
shores, he proposed to Congress that we become "the great 

97 



arsenal of Democracy." After two months of debate [Janu- 
ary 6-March 11, 1941], Congress passed the Lend-Lease Bill 
by large majorities in both houses, and two weeks later voted 
seven billion dollars to meet the first installment of the costs. 

Under Lend-Lease the President was empowered to manu- 
facture, sell, lend, lease, or exchange any war materiel to 
*'the government of any country whose defense the Presi- 
dent deems vital to the defense of the United States." The 
terms and conditions upon which foreign governments re- 
ceived such aid were "those which the President deems satis- 
factory," and the benefit to the United States might be 
"payment or repayment in kind or property, or any other 
direct or indirect benefit which the President deems satis- 
factory." In short, the President was given complete discre- 
tion to aid any country resisting the Axis, because its re- 
sistance was of aid to the defense of the United States; there 
need be no repayment, if the President wished none, beyond 
this contribution to American defense. 

Lend-Lease was restricted at first by a special time limit 
and a fixed maximum of expense, but it was subsequently 
renewed and additional appropriations were voted; thirty 
billion dollars had been spent by April 1944. Of this amount, 
nearly twenty billion went in war goods and services to the 
British Empire; over four billion to the Soviet Union; over 
two billion to Latin America, chiefly to Brazil; and half a 
billion to China. More than half of all this money was spent 
after the middle of 1943, when American production had at 
last expanded sufficiently to satisfy both our own needs and 
those of our allies. Up to the middle of 1943, the actual cost 
of Lend-Lease was nearly thirteen billion dollars; almost 
half of this amount was spent on planes, tanks, ships, guns, 
munitions, and trucks, and the remainder for raw materials, 
machinery, food, clothes, and services. 

To the question, "Have we got our money's worth?" Lend- 
Lease Administrator Edward R. Stettinius, Jr., replied: "I 
think that we have in more than double measure ... If we 
had not had Lend-Lease, ... if Britain had gone under, 
Hitler had isolated Russia, Japan had completed the con- 
quest of China, and finally we in the Western Hemisphere 
had stood alone against an Axis-dominated world, who can 

98 



measure the expenditure of men and of our material wealth 
we would have had to make if our liberties were to survive?" 
The answer to this question may be guessed from the fact 
that three years of Lend-Lease cost the United States thirty 
billion dollars, but every month of fighting in 1944 cost this 
country alone eight billion dollars. 

Lend-Lease did not confine the United States to a spend- 
ing program. Quite apart from the contributions made to 
American defense by Great Britain, the Soviet Union, and 
China in fighting against the Axis, there was also Reverse 
Lend-Lease which increased steadily as the war went on. 
By the middle of 1944, Great Britain and the Dominions had 
repaid over two billion dollars in supplies given to our troops 
abroad. For all the aid granted the Soviet Union, wrote Mr. 
Stettinius, "the Russians have already made a return far 
beyond any measurement in dollars or tons. It is in the form 
of millions of Nazi soldiers dead or in Russian prison camps, 
of Nazi tanks reduced to scrap on the battlefields, of Nazi 
guns and trucks left behind by the retreating German armies 
. . . The war will be much the shorter for it." 

In a report to Congress in the spring of 1944, President 
Roosevelt reviewed the results of Lend-Lease. Of every dol- 
lar spent by the United States in fighting the war, fourteen 
cents had gone to Lend-Lease. Out of this small proportion 
of our total war costs we had shipped to our Allies over 
twenty-three thousand planes, as many tanks, and more than 
half a million motor vehicles. In addition, the Allies had 
bought in cash seven thousand planes, two thousand tanks, 
and a quarter of a million motor vehicles. 

To the Soviet Union, for $4,750,000,000, went 8,800 
planes, 5,200 tanks and tank destroyers, 190,000 military 
trucks, 36,000 jeeps, 30,000 other motor vehicles, 7,000,000 
pairs of military boots, 2,600,000 tons of food, 1,450,000 
tons of steel, 420,000 tons of aluminum, copper, nickel, zinc, 
and brass, 200,000 tons of high explosives, and $200,000,000 
worth of machine tools. Two-thirds of all these supplies were 
shipped to Russia late in the war, between March 1943, 
and March 1944. 

The great stream of supplies flowing to the United King- 
dom included over one billion dollars' worth of ordnance, 

99 



nearly as much in tanks and military vehicles, two hundred 
million dollars' worth of landing craft for the invasion of 
Europe, 5,750,000 tons of steel, 500,000 tons of other metals, 
and several hundred thousand tons of high explosives for 
bombs to mount the air offensive against Germany. The 
larger part of these supplies for Britain, like those for Russia, 
were shipped overseas in 1943 and 1944 to prepare great 
offensives. 

A considerable volume of Lend-Lease aid went to the Mid- 
dle East and Pacific earlier in the war, because of the urgent 
need to hold and defend these theaters. With this assistance, 
British and French forces turned the tide of battle in the 
Middle East and made possible the British and American 
invasion of North Africa in 1942. French Colonial forces in 
this region were trained and equipped with $300,000,000 
worth of Lend-Lease supplies. In the Pacific, Australia and 
New Zealand received $200,000,000 worth of planes, tanks, 
and military vehicles valued at the same amount. Two billion 
dollars in materiel went to these British Dominions, and 
to India, China, and the Netherlands East Indies, three- 
fifths of it military equipment for fighting the enemy. In 
India, two Chinese divisions were trained and equipped un- 
der Lieutenant General (now General) Joseph W. Stilwell 
for the campaign in Burma. 

The contribution which American Lend-Lease made toward 
winning the war was to be found on every battlefield of the 
United Nations after 1941. The tragic weakness of all the 
nations fighting the Axis in the first two years of war — too 
little, too late — was slowly transformed into an overpower- 
ing superiority of armament, fire power, mobility, and sup- 
ply. This was due in part to Lend-Lease. Even in the darkest 
days of the war American equipment helped to hold the 
enemy in the Middle East, in Russia, in China, in India, 
and in the South Pacific; now it was a firm foundation of 
victory. 

14. WHAT AMERICA DEFENDED 

In his message to Congress proposing Lend-Lease aid to 
the democracies fighting the Axis [January 6, 1941], Presi- 
100 



dent Roosevelt declared that our policy was "all-inclusive 
national defense." The defense of a nation, he implied, should 
safeguard more than the land and water which make up a 
country. It should give security to a people and to their way 
of life. The American way of life is essentially democratic in 
spirit and ideals. It cannot easily be defined, but is implicit 
in our whole history and forms part of the experience of every 
American. It would not be safe, said the President, if we 
consented to "a peace dictated by aggressors and sponsored 
by appeasers," for "enduring peace cannot be bought at the 
cost of other peoples' freedom." 

Warning the Fascist powers that we would not live in a 
world divided between tyranny and democracy, the Presi- 
dent proclaimed that we looked "forward to a world founded 
upon four essential freedoms." To call for a peace based upon 
these freedoms wasn't to envision a distant millenium. "It 
is a definite basis," he said, "for a kind of world attainable 
in our own time and generation. That kind of world is the 
very antithesis of the so-called new order of tyranny which 
the dictators seek to create with the crash of a bomb. To 
that new order we oppose the greater conception — the moral 
order." 

Four Freedoms 

The President proposed that four freedoms, born of Ameri- 
can experience, should prevail "everywhere in the world." 
They were of two kinds, positive and negative, the right to do 
something, which could be done only if something else did 
not interfere. "Freedom of speech and expression" and "free- 
dom of every person to worship God in his own way" were 
individual liberties essential to Democracy. Without them 
no man could call his soul his own; without them he would 
not be a free human being. But these liberties could not exist 
unless there were prosperity and peace in the world — free- 
dom from want and from fear. The third — "freedom from 
want" — was translated by the President into world terms to 
mean "economic understandings which will secure to every 
nation a healthy peacetime life for its inhabitants." The 
fourth — "freedom from fear" — he defined as "a worldwide 
reduction of armaments to such a point and in such a thor- 

101 



ough fashion that no nation will be in a position to commit 
an act of physical aggression against any neighbor." These, 
then, were the four freedoms: the right of every person to 
think, speak, and worship as he pleased, secured by preserv- 
ing the prosperity and peace of every nation. 

The Atlantic Charter 

The four freedoms were incorporated, not in so many 
words but in their essence, in the document called the At- 
lantic Charter which President Roosevelt drafted with Prime 
Minister Churchill at their first meeting aboard American 
and British warships anchored off Newfoundland in the sum- 
mer of 1941 [August 3-14, 1941]. They met with their staffs 
to discuss problems of Lend-Lease supply and to arrange for 
the support of the Soviet Union in its war against Hitler. 
But they also "considered the dangers to world civilization 
arising from the policies of military domination by conquest 
upon which the Hitlerite government of Germany" had em- 
barked. In the Atlantic Charter they drew up a "declaration 
of principles" to which all men unwilling to compromise with 
the Nazis could subscribe, "a goal which is worth while for 
our type of civilization to seek." Before the United States 
entered the war, it reached an agreement with Great Britain 
on the basic terms of peace. 

In the Atlantic Charter, the President of the United States 
and the Prime Minister of Great Britain set down "certain 
common principles in the national policies" of their coun- 
tries "on which they base their hopes for a better future for 
the world." There were eight principles: 

First, their countries seek no aggrandizement, territorial or 
other ; 

Second, they desire to see no territorial changes that do not 
accord with the freely expressed wishes of the peoples concerned; 

Third, they respect the right of all peoples to choose the form 
of government under which they will live; and they wish to see 
sovereign rights and self-government restored to those who have 
. been forcibly deprived of them; 

Fourth, they will endeavor, with due respect for their existing 
obligations, to further the enjoyment by all states, great or small, 
victor or vanquished, of access, on equal terms, to the trade and 
to the raw materials of the world which are needed for their eco- 
nomic prosperity; 

102 



Fifth, they desire to bring about the fullest collaboration be- 
tween all nations in the economic field with the object of securing, 
for all, improved labor standards, economic advancement, and 
social security ; 

Sixth, after the final destruction of the Nazi tyranny, they hope 
to see established a peace which will afford to all nations the means 
of dwelling in safety within their own boundaries, and which will 
afford assurance that all the men in all the lands may live out 
their lives in freedom from fear and want ; 

Seventh, such a peace should enable all men to traverse the high 
seas and oceans without hindrance; 

Eighth, they beheve that all of the nations of the world, for 
realistic as well as spiritual reasons, must come to the abandon- 
ment of the use of force. Since no future peace can be maintained 
if land, sea, or air armaments contmue to be employed by nations 
which threaten, or may threaten, aggression outside of their fron- 
tiers, they believe, pending the estabHshment of a wider and i>er- 
manent system of general security, that the disarmament of such 
nations is essential. They will likewise aid and encourage all other 
practicable measures which will lighten for peace-loving peoples 
the crushing burden of armaments.

PART FOUR 

THE UNITED NATIONS ON 
THE DEFENSIVE 



15. AXIS AND ALLIED STRATEGY AFTER 
PEARL HARBOR 

All "hopes for a better future for the world" expressed in 
the Atlantic Charter became doubly difficult to achieve when 
Japan attacked in the Pacific. No longer was Hitler the only 
enemy, with Europe and Africa the only battlefields; the 
Nazis were reinforced by the Japanese, and war swept over 
the whole world. The Axis powers, leagued together in mili- 
tary as well as diplomatic alliance, fought to complete the 
world conquest upon which they were already well advanced, 
Germany in Europe and Japan in Asia. 

In this vast undertaking the aggressors enjoyed two great 
advantages over their enemies: they were already well pre- 
pared and fully mobilized. Interior lines of supply also fa- 
vored their operations. At the peak of its military and naval 
power early in 1942, the Axis controlled a force so tremen- 
dous that it could mount offensives simultaneously in Europe, 
Africa, Asia, the Pacific, and the Atlantic. Under attack by 
land, sea, and air, the LFnited Nations were everywhere on 
the defensive. For a year or more they would have to struggle 
to hold what they had, to keep lines of communication open 
around the world, and to lose no time in transforming their 
superior industrial resources into fighting strength. The great 
question they had to answer was how soon they could as- 
sume the counteroffensive. If they took too long, they would 
be defeated before they were ready to fight with all their 
strength. A quick victory was impossible for the Allies be- 
cause, quite apart from lack of preparation, they depended 
on exterior lines of supply. Germany and Japan each held 
a central military position at the hub of its continental wheel. 
The United Nations and their possessions were scattered 
around the rims. 

104 



Yet the space that separated the chief Axis powers and 
limited each to its own radius, was their main weakness, pre- 
venting the pooHng of Japan's naval strength with Germany's 
land and air power and the combining of all their resources. 
The Axis realized the power to be gained from a union of 
force. Their offensive strategy in 1942 may have anticipated 
the ultimate goal of locking arms in India, toward which 
both converged — Japan by enveloping Southeast Asia and 
Germany by attacking eastward through the Russian Cau- 
casus and Egypt. If their armies should meet, they would 
outflank and isolate both Russia and China; Great Britain 
and the United States would be cut off from their allies and 
besieged. This was the offensive strategy of the Axis in the 
long run; the immediate defensive plan behind Japan's en- 
tering the war was, as was pointed out earlier, to engage the 
United States on two fronts. 

For the United Nations a fateful decision had to be made 
in the days following Pearl Harbor, when Prime Minister 
Churchill met President Roosevelt in Washington. Which 
front was the more important, Europe or Asia? Who was, in 
the language of the American police, "Public Enemy No. 1," 
Hitler or the Japanese militarists led by General Tojo? Upon 
the answer to these questions of strategic priority depended 
the length of the war and possibly even the victory of the 
United Nations, none of whom, not even the United States, 
was strong enough to fight both Germany and Japan with 
equal power. The military principle of economy of force re- 
quired that sufficient power should be concentrated against 
first one enemy, then the other, splitting up and defeating 
them in detail. Opinion among the peoples of the United 
Nations was somewhat divided in selecting the more dan- 
gerous enemy, Germany or Japan. In China, Australia, New 
Zealand, India, throughout the Pacific, and on the American 
West Coast public opinion naturally feared Japan who was 
already close and coming closer. But the people of Great 
Britain, Russia, and occupied Europe looked on Hitler as 
their chief enemy because they were already at grips with 
him. 

After Pearl Harbor the fundamental decision of the Com- 
bined Chiefs of Staff in Washington v/as to beat Germany 

105 



first, while holding Japan at bay. They planned to launch 
major offensives as soon as possible on the primary fronts in 
Africa and Europe and limited offensives on the secondary 
fronts of the Pacific and Asia. "The defeat of Hitler and the 
breaking of German power," as Churchill said later, "must 
have priority over the decisive phase of the war against 
Japan." This decision, reached early in 1942, was never 
changed. Events which no man could then foresee have since 
justified it. Fortunately for the United Nations, however, the 
speed and magnitude of American production enabled the 
United States to assume an unlimited offensive in the Pa- 
cific even before Germany was fully crushed. 

The reason Allied strategy was concentrated first against 
Germany rather than Japan was that the Nazis presented a 
more serious immediate threat. The industrial war potential 
of Germany, with the resources of occupied Europe at her 
command, surpassed that of Japan even with her control of 
Asia. German-ruled Europe produced four times as much 
steel as Japan. The annual Japanese output could never ex- 
ceed ten million metric tons, for all the raw materials and 
labor conquered in Asia had to be fed into the limited indus- 
trial machine of Japan itself. Once Germany was defeated, 
Japan could not hope to match the United Nations in pro- 
duction. 

Another consideration in Allied strategy was the fact that 
Germany was nearer than Japan to the three strongest Al- 
lies — the United States, Great Britain, and the Soviet Union. 
They could strike much more quickly and directly at Ger- 
many; indeed, there were already two fronts established 
against the Nazis in Russia and Africa. A front against 
Japan, except in China and over the far distances of the 
Pacific, had yet to be set up. Britain, Russia, and Africa, 
already far stronger than Australia or India, were compara- 
tively accessible bases from which to prosecute the war. 

Unlike the Axis, the United Nations could reinforce one 
another by sea and concentrate their strength where needed. 
Determining the most economical use of that force was a 
final concern in their strategy. Hitler's defeat was prerequisite 
to victory over Japan, for if he could add the resources of 
Russia to his empire, his power would be irresistible. No such 

106 



reserve of power was within reach of Japan. With relatively 
small forces, largely air and naval, Japanese expansion might 
be checked until Allied strength could be shifted from Eu- 
rope to the Pacific. Then overwhelming strength could be 
concentrated to drive the Japanese back to their home is- 
lands and crush their power at its source. 

So the United States made the wise decision to join her 
Allies in fighting a global war on all fronts in the order of 
their strategic importance. To concentrate American force in 
the Pacific apart from our Allies would be to throw away the 
obvious advantages of a coalition, to let the Axis once more 
''divide and conquer." The strategy of uniting with our 
neighbors, first worked out in Lend-Lease, when any Axis 
attack on another nation was seen to endanger the United 
States, had proved its wisdom. The direct attack of Japan 
upon Pearl Harbor had aroused the fighting temper of all 
Americans. They were impatient to avenge it. But they were 
wise enough to keep their powder dry, and bide their time in 
the Pacific, so that they could defeat all their enemies, each 
in his own time and, it was hoped, for all time. 



16. RISE OF THE UNITED NATIONS 

With almost the whole world at war, the United States 
proposed that all the nations hostile to the Axis pledge their 
cooperation in waging war and agree not to make a separate 
peace or armistice. A declaration to this effect was signed at 
Washington [January 1, 1942] by the representatives of 
twenty-six governments: the United States of America, 
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, 
Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, China, Australia, Bel- 
gium, Canada, Costa Rica, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, Domini- 
can Republic, El Salvador, Greece, Guatemala, Haiti, Hon- 
duras, India, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, 
Nicaragua, Norway, Panama, Poland, South Africa, and 
Yugoslavia. They were joined later in 1942 by Mexico, the 
Philippine Commonwealth, and Ethiopia, and in 1943 by 
Iraq, Brazil, and Bolivia. General Charles de Gaulle, repre- 
senting the Free French, had also subscribed his name. Thus 

107 



thirty-three governments in the New and Old Worlds were 
united in the war. 

In the Declaration of Washington all the United Nations 
subscribed to the "purposes and principles" of the Atlantic 
Charter. Their indorsement transformed it into a world 
charter. The United Nations further declared in the Charter 
"complete victory over their enemies is essential to defend 
life, liberty, independence, and religious freedom, and to 
preserve human rights and justice in their own lands as well 
as in other lands." For the survival of these values they "en- 
gaged in a common struggle against savage and brutal forces 
seeking to subjugate the world." To carry on this struggle, 
each government promised to employ "its full resources, 
military or economic," against the Axis powers with which 
it was at war, to cooperate with the other United Nations, 
and "not to make a separate armistice or peace with the 



enemies." 



These pledges among the United Nations, the statecraft 
of war, were formulated slowly and painfully at the confer- 
ences of diplomats, but their actual working out was swift 
and efficient on the fields of battle. Inevitably the more pow- 
erful countries took the lead, both in diplomacy and war, 
and the very loose military alliance of the United Nations 
found its voice and strength in the United States, Great 
Britain, the Soviet Union, and China. The agreement of these 
four powers gave promise of a coalition of manpower, re- 
sources, and strategy sufficient to defeat the Axis, and if the 
Atlantic Charter were observed, to crush Fascism and extend 
Democracy. 

Joint Anglo-American strategic command, to insure "full 
British and American collaboration with the United Na- 
tions," was vested in the Combined Chiefs of Staff, appointed 
in Washington by President Roosevelt and Prime Minister 
Churchill at their first conference following Pearl Harbor 
[February 6, 1942]. The United States was represented by 
Generals (now Generals of the Army) George C. Marshall 
and Henry H. Arnold, and Admirals (now Fleet Admirals) 
Ernest J. King and Harold R. Stark; Great Britain by Field 
Marshal the late Sir John Dill, Admiral Sir Charles Little, 
Air Marshal A. T. Harris, and Lieutenant General Sir Col- 

108 



viile Wemyss. These eight men became responsible for plan- 
ning the Anglo-American war effort at the highest levels of 
military strategy, and their advice was the foundation of all 
the military decisions made by Roosevelt and Churchill. The 
fact that the Combined Chiefs of Staff sat together in almost 
daily sessions in Washington gave Britain and America the 
benefits of unified strategic command; neither country fought 
the war alone, but could rely on combined manpower and 
resources in all theaters of operations. Liaison was main- 
tained with the Soviet Union through an Allied Military 
Mission to Moscow, and with China by the Allied Military 
Council at Chungking. Each of the four leading United Na- 
tions was fighting the enemy on a major front. 



17. THE JAPANESE OFFENSIVE IN THE PACIFIC 

The strategy of Japan's amphibious warfare, which swept 
over the islands of the southern Pacific in 1942 as the Ger- 
man blitzkrieg had overwhelmed western Europe in 1940, 
was to win control over the rich resources and numerous 
populations of Asia. Five hundred million Orientals, more 
easily exploited than the politically conscious peoples of Hit- 
ler's Europe, offered a labor power with which Japan could 
hope to achieve world dominion. In Malaya and the Nether- 
lands East Indies she would gain not only all the oil she 
needed, but eighty-five per cent of the world's rubber and six- 
ty-five per cent of its tin, and her gains would be at the ex- 
pense of democratic nations, making the United States weak 
and Japan strong. It was no idle dream of Japanese imperial- 
ists that with these advantages the "eight corners" of the 
world might eventually be brought under the roof of the 
Mikado's palace. 

Nor were the Japanese war lords completely irrational 
when they struck at the United States and Great Britain. 
The year 1941 and even 1942 promised to be Axis years. 
Great Britain was fighting for her life in the Middle East; 
Soviet Russia was staggering under the impact of the Nazi 
invasion; and the United States, unprepared for a war on 

109 



two fronts, was desperately trying to support Britain and 
Russia with Lend-Lease supplies. Timing meant everything 
if Japan were to dominate Asia while the other Great Powers 
of the world had their hands tied by Hitler. 

Hence the Japanese launched a centrifugal offensive from 
bases in Formosa, French Indo-China, and the Pacific islands, 
with simultaneous blows at almost every point of the com- 
pass — Pearl Harbor, Midway, Wake, Guam, the Philippines, 
Hong Kong, Malaya, and Singapore. Germany had fought 
on one front at a time; Japan struck all fronts. Pearl Harbor 
came first because it was essential to neutralize the United 
States Pacific Fleet and free the route of conquest to Malaya, 
the Netherlands East Indies, and the islands of the Pacific. 
These Asiatic treasure houses were isolated by the temporary 
crippling of the American Navy at Pearl Harbor, where the 
United States was caught unprepared and compelled as a 
result to fight on the defensive for a year, until American 
men and industries were mobilized for action. The situation 
in Europe gave Japan her opportunity in Asia. 

Japanese Envelopment of Southeast Asia 

The fall of France and the Netherlands in the spring of 

1940 had diverted Japan from China to rich but defenseless 
French Indo-China and Netherlands East Indies, which now 
promised easy pickings. Under pressure from Hitler as well 
as Japan, the French Vichy Government opened Indo-China 
to Japanese agents [June 20, 1940], and by a pact signed at 
Hanoi, conceded three airfields and admitted a garrison of 
sixty thousand Japanese troops [September 22, 1940] . Japan 
then gained control of Saigon, only 650 miles north of Singa- 
pore, and converted it into a naval base. Thailand, formerly 
known as Siam, fell under Japanese domination early in 

1941 when Tokyo dictated a settlement of her dispute with 
Indo-China to the advantage of the Thai — and the Japanese. 
From bases in Indo-China and later in Thailand, Japan was 
ready to swoop down upon Malaya, Singapore, the Nether- 
lands East Indies, and Burma. 

Great Britain could not hold these regions, the richest 
part of which belonged to her, because, as Churchill said, she 

110 



was "engaged in a life-and-death struggle" in Europe and 
the Mediterranean. In order to appease Japan, Britain had 
in January 1939, suspended the supply of China through 
Hong Kong and, for three months, closed the Burma Road. 
Not only did Britain lack the air power in the Far East to * 
resist Japan, but with the paralysis of the U. S. Pacific Fleet 
at Pearl Harbor and the sinking of the Prince of Wales and 
Repulse three days later, no power was available to stop 
Japan north of Australia and east of India. The Netherlands 
East Indies, reinforced at the last moment by limited Amer- 
ican supplies, could do no more than fight a delaying action. 
Taking advantage of this military and naval situation in 
the far distances of the Pacific, a situation created partly 
by her own diplomacy but above all by Hitler's success in 
Europe, Japan overran the colonies of Southeast Asia in 
four short months. With a force estimated by Churchill at 
twenty-six divisions, the Japanese enveloped East Asia and 
conquered all the aslands of the Southwest Pacific between 
Australia and the Asiatic mainland. 

I. HONG KONG, MALAYA, SINGAPORE, BURMA 

The main force with which the Japanese enveloped South- 
east Asia was an army of some 200,000 troops in French 
Indo-China. Their intentions were hidden behind the diplo- 
matic smoke screen which their envoys raised in Washing- 
ton, where they pretended to be negotiating a peaceful set- 
tlement of all differences. When the Japanese carrier force 
struck Pearl Harbor, well supplied armies were prepared to 
move on Thailand, Malaya, Singapore, and Burma. Addi- 
tional troops, specially trained in jungle warfare and in all 
the requirements of their different missions, were ready in 
the island of Formosa and on the coast of occupied China. 
Not only the Pearl Harbor attack but the many others made 
in Asia and the Pacific by the Japanese had been carefully 
planned long before their execution. Tactical success de- 
pended on speed and surprise, and the enemy achieved both 
by striking Hong Kong, Manila, Thailand, Singapore, Mid- 
way, Wake, and Guam at the same time that they raided 
Pearl Harbor. 

HI 



Hong Kong 

The British crown colony of Hong Kong, deep-water port 
of Canton in southeastern China, was the apex of a triangle 
based on Singapore and Corregidor, within which Anelo- 
American power in the Far East was concentrated. The 
Japanese occupation of Canton in the war against China, 
and of French Indo-China and Hainan Island in 1940-41, 
had enclosed Hong Kong and would be able to cut it off 
from Singapore, fourteen hundred miles south, on the out- 
break of the war. Though Hong Kong was doomed, a delay- 
ing action fought in its defense would give Britain and Amer- 
ica time to reinforce other positions in the Pacific. Late in 
November, some three thousand Canadian reinforcements 
landed, bringing the total strength of the Anglo-Indian gar- 
rison to about twelve thousand men, poorly equipped, bur- 
dened with crowds of Chinese refugees, and without any 
liaison with Chinese troops on the mainland. 

Japanese dive bombers opened the attack on Hong Kong 
at the same hour that other planes were striking Pearl Har- 
bor [December 8, 1941'^]. Air strip, hangars, and old train- 
ing planes — all the air power of the garrison — were destroyed 
and Hong Kong was at the mercy of Japanese bombers. 
Ground troops penetrated Kwangtung Peninsula and over- 
came the strongpoint of the inner line of resistance on Kow- 
loon. As the British withdrew to the island of Hong Kong, 
the Japanese bombed and shelled reservoirs of the colony 
until there was only one day's water supply left [December 
18-24, 1941]. The British surrendered the next day. Even 
if there had been water they could not have resisted much 
longer, for Japanese troops had crossed the harbor, had 
landed, had expanded a bridgehead, had infiltrated the Brit- 
ish lines, had survived all counterattacks, and had narrowed 
the siege to Victoria Peak. With the fall of Hong Kong the 
last major port into Free China was closed [December 25, 
1941]. 

Malaya 

From the frontier of Thailand, which had surrendered 

1 Dates west of the International Date Line, following 180° West 
Longitude, are one day later than those in the United States. 

112 



after token resistance [December 8, 1941], and French Indo- 
China the Japanese moved swiftly south through the British 
Malay States to Singapore, 580 miles away. The Malay 
States not only provided a highway to Singapore but were 
a rich prize in themselves, for they produced nearly half the 
world's rubber and over a quarter of its tin. Against the Brit- 
ish Imperial III Corps, consisting of Scottish, Australian, and 
Indian units, holding the main roads, the Japanese sent their 
best troops, a force of four or five divisions trained to ad- 
vance through the rice-field swamps, traveling light, some- 
times clothed only in loin cloths, and easily mistaken for 
Malay natives as they infiltrated British lines. In a global 
war of machines Japan's armies perfected the tactics of jun- 
gle warfare. 

Since the Japanese required air cover for their overland 
advances, they always seized airfields first. Thus the attack 
on the long, narrow Malay Peninsula began with landings 
on the east coast and in Thailand [December 8-9, 1941] to 
pinch off the airdrome at Kota Bharu, and to take the fields 
at Singora and Patani. From the latter points a division 
equipped with light tanks and armored cars cut across the 
neck of the peninsula to the west coast and threatened to 
envelop the British Imperial 11th Division, which fell back, 
uncovering Penang. After the capture of this important island 
port, evacuated by the panic-stricken white residents, the 
Japanese pressed steadily down the west coast, turning 
strongpoints by amphibious hops and outflanking British 
positions with a series of surprise raids in which the defend- 
ers suddenly found themselves behind enemy lines. From 
the east coast, after overcoming strong resistance at Kota 
Bharu, the Japanese advanced southward along an inland 
railway, pushing the British Imperial 9th Division before 
them. The mobility of Japanese units enabled them to in- 
filtrate and envelop each receding line of British defense. 
Another enemy force drove down the east coast. All three 
Japanese drives converged on a common front in Johore, less 
than one hundred miles above Singapore [December 29, 
1941]. 

The fate of the great naval base, and of the troops cover- 
ing it in Malaya, was sealed by the early sinking of the bat- 

113 



tleship Prince of Wales and the battle cruiser Repulse [De- 
cember 10, 1941], caught without air cover by Japanese tor- 
pedo planes off Kuantan on the east Malay coast. The de- 
struction of these mighty British warships was a triumph of 
air power. It deprived the combined forces of the British, 
Dutch, and Americans of any effective naval strength in 
Southeast Asia, reduced the conquest of that region to a 
land-and-air problem for the Japanese, and freed them to 
sweep the seas south through the Indies to Australia. To the 
Allies it was a tactical misfortune no less serious than the 
strategic blow suffered at Pearl Harbor. 

In a desperate effort to save the situation in Malaya, the 
Allied command in Southeast Asia was reorganized and uni- 
fied, the result of British-American discussions in Washing- 
ton. General Sir Archibald Wavell assumed supreme com- 
mand [January 3, 1942] ; his deputy. Lieutenant General 
George H. Brett, directed the weak air forces, and Admiral 
Thomas C. Hart took charge of such naval forces as were left. 
Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek was head of all land and 
air forces isolated in China. But this change of command 
came too late and was not of sufficient force to relieve the 
British forces in Malaya. At the Slim River they were de- 
feated by about thirty enemy tanks [January 7 , 1942] and 
driven relentlessly south from Kuala Lumpur to the Johore 
Causeway connecting Malaya with the island of Singapore. 
Scottish Highlanders and Australians covered the withdrawal 
[January 30-31, 1942] of remnants of British III Corps 
which had rallied to the defense of Singapore. The land ap- 
proaches to this naval base had been conquered by the Japa- 
nese in less than two months; they had swept south through 
Malaya over five hundred miles, waging blitzkrieg in the 
jungles, rice swamps and rubber forests in which superior 
forces and tactics caught the British off guard and swept 
them aside. 

Singapore 

The naval base on Singapore Island was prepared to re- 
sist assault from the sea, but not from the jungles in the 
rear, or from the skies. All fighter planes had been recalled 
from Malaya before Christmas to beat off the flights of 

114 



thirty to ninety Japanese bombers which raided Singapore 
three times or more every day. Air defense, even when rein- 
forced by a squadron of Hurricanes recently arrived at Singa- 
pore, was inadequate. The Japanese aerial siege persisted 
for over a month [December 29, 1941-February 8, 1942], 
and by that time enemy ground troops were in position to 
launch their assault across the river-like Strait of Johore. 
Under cover of intense artillery bombardment the invaders 
secured a bridgehead at Kranji, made two other landings 
east and west [February 8-9, 1942], and converged on the 
city of Singapore in the south after isolating the naval base 
and water reservoirs. The defenders were hopelessly cut up. 
Singapore surrendered unconditionally seventy days from 
Japan's first attack on Malaya [February 15, 1942]. The 
enemy had not only reduced a naval fortress once consid- 
ered impregnable, but had captured some seventy thousand 
British Imperial troops. The fall of Singapore, according to 
Prime Minister Churchill, was "the greatest disaster to Brit- 
ish arms which history records." It was likewise a death blow 
to Allied forces left stranded in Southeast Asia, for it com- 
pelled them to fall back to the Netherlands East Indies, and 
eventually to Australia. Worst of all, the way lay open for 
the Japanese to attack Burma and India. 

Burma 

The Japanese invaded lower Burma from Thailand early^ 
in the Malaya campaign. Their object was to protect the 
right flank and rear of troops pushing south to Singapore 
by neutralizing the Burmese airfields. But the RAF and the 
American Volunteer Group of "Flying Tigers" retained local 
control of the air against a superior force of enemy bombers. 
Japanese ground troops, however, soon gained possession 
of lower Burma. The British evacuated Moulmein, fell back 
on the main port of Rangoon, where supply was badly dis- 
organized by enemy bombing, and prepared to defend upper 
Burma on the line of the Salween River [January 31, 1942] . 

Foreseeing the fall of Singapore, the main Japanese forces 
in Thailand entered Burma to cut the Burma Road and iso- 
late China [February 8, 1942]. They enveloped the southern 
flank of the British position by landings across the Salween 

115 



River and drove the defenders west to the Sittang {February 
23, 1942], cutting up some British units as they crossed the 
river. Rangoon was evacuated after heavy bombing and a 
Japanese thrust to Pegu had made the great port appear 
untenable [March 8, 1942]. The loss of Rangoon cut the 
supply lines of the British and Chinese forces in Burma; 
the only remaining means of communication with India was 
by air. British troops retreated north to Prome, fighting their 
way through enemy lines. 

Large Chinese forces under Lieutenant General (now Gen- 
eral) Joseph W. Stilwell were sent into north Burma by 
Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. The Japanese moved north 
so rapidly in pursuit of the British, however, that the Chinese 
were left in the position of covering the withdrawal of Im- 
perial troops to India. Their own withdrawal became neces- 
sary [April 26, 1942] when Japanese motorized troops pene- 
trated to Lashio, split the Allied forces, and cut the Burma 
Road. As the enemy continued north to Bhamo and Myitky- 
ina, the British escaped west over jungle trails to Imphal in 
India, while the Chinese retreated north up the Salween 
River into their own country. By the end of May the Japa- 
nese had occupied all of Burma, a land a little larger than 
France, and cut off all connections between China and her 
allies, except by air over the hazardous Himalayan "hump" 
to India. 

Even India was threatened by a large Japanese naval force 
of three battleships and five aircraft carriers screened by 
cruisers and destroyers, which entered the Bay of Bengal 
and struck the island of Ceylon [April 4, 1942]. Japanese 
planes raided Colombo in force [April 9, 1942], and sank 
two heavy British cruisers, the Cornwall and Dorsetshire, 
and the carrier Hermes. Nearly all the British planes attack- 
ing the enemy carriers were shot down. As Japanese sub- 
marines sank numerous merchant ships and the carrier force 
raided the mainland of India, the British rushed naval rein- 
forcements to the East to hold the Indian Ocean, By early 
summer the British had three battleships and an aircraft 
carrier in the Bay of Bengal to thwart any Japanese attack. 
The onset of heavy monsoon rains protected the peninsula 
from overland invasion through Burma.

II. THE PHILIPPINES: BATAAN AND CORREGIDOR; THE N.E.I. 

The defense of the PhiUppine Islands was a gallant de- 
laying action which slowed down the Japanese advance into 
the South Pacific. It was never intended to hold the Philip- 
pines at all costs. Since the islands were untenable for long, 
American supply was directed to building up trans-Pacific 
lines to Australia in order to keep the continent "down un- 
der" as a base from which a counteroffensive could later be 
launched for the reconquest of the Philippines. 

The fate of the Philippines was settled before the war 
began. They were almost surrounded by the Japanese, who 
were north in Formosa, west in the Spratly Islands and Indo- 
China, and east in the Mariannas, Caroline, and Marshall 
Islands. Since the U. S. Congress had voted in 1934 to make 
the Philippines independent in 1946, little had been done to 
protect them. General (now General of the Army) Douglas 
MacArthur was appointed in 1937 by the Filipino govern- 
ment to train a native army, but when war broke out, not 
more than one hundred thousand Filipinos had become sol- 
diers. Twelve thousand Philippine Scouts, the best trained 
of these men, together with the U. S. 31st Infantry, bore the 
brunt of the fighting. Altogether, nineteen thousand U. S. 
Army troops defended the islands at the time of the attack. 
Included in this number were some eight thousand Army Air 
Forces personnel, equipped with about 250 aircraft, of which 
35 were Flying Fortresses and 107 were P-40 fighters. Among 
the ground troops were National Guard units from New 
'Mexico, California, Kentucky, Ohio, and Illinois. The 4th 
Marine Regiment, recalled from Shanghai, was also stationed 
in the Philippines at this time. In addition, during the final 
stand on Bataan, there were one thousand sailors without 
ships, eighteen thousand civilians evacuated from other 
areas, and some six thousand laborers. The situation in the 
other islands was much worse. In Mindanao, second to Luzon 
in size. Brigadier General (now Major General) William F. 
Sharp did not have enough small arms for the thirty thou- 
sand Filipinos who could be called into service; in the island 
of Cebu only fifteen hundred old rifles were on hand. In the 
first two months of war, munitions and supplies from New 

117 



Zealand were run in through Japanese blockade, but for 
every ship which arrived safely two were lost. Soldiers were 
soon reduced to living on short rations. 

The Japanese neutralized our offensive power at the start. 
Nine hours after Pearl Harbor, an enemy raid destroyed most 
of the heavy bombers and fighter planes [December 8, 1941]. 
Two days later Japanese planes wrecked the naval base at 
Cavite. Luckily, Admiral Thomas C. Hart's Asiatic "Fleet" 
of two cruisers, twenty-four patrol planes, the tender Lang- 
ley, a squadron of destroyers, and many submarines had 
evacuated the base and gone south to help bring ten convoys 
of British reinforcements into Singapore. Later this fleet 
fought delaying actions in the Java Sea in defense of the 
Netherlands East Indies and almost every ship was sunk, 
but not before each had taken its count of an overwhelming 
enemy. 

Bataan 

Japanese troops first landed at Aparri and Vigan on the 
northern coast of Luzon three days after Pearl Harbor [De- 
cember 10, 1941]; ten days later new landings were made 
at Davao on Mindanao Island, six hundred miles south of 
Manila. When Japan reinforced the troops in Luzon, by 
landings in Lamon Bay below Manila, and closed in on the 
city from north and south. General Douglas MacArthur ex- 
ecuted defense plans drawn up several years before and 
withdrew all his forces westward into the rocky Bataan 
Peninsula, guarded at the tip by the island forts of Corregi- 
dor. Manila, declared an open city, was nevertheless bombed, 
and finally occupied by the Japanese [January 2, 1942]. 

On Bataan the Filipino-American forces at first made a 
stand in defense of the secondary naval base at Subic Bay. 
Enemy reinforcements compelled them to fall back south- 
ward to the main line of resistance across the center of the 
Peninsula. Here in foxholes they held their position from 
the middle of January until April, putting up a gallant de- 
fense which inspired Americans at home to resolve that the 
men of Bataan should not die in vain. During these months 
the main Japanese forces were busy with the conquest of 
Malaya, Singapore, Burma, and the Netherlands East Indies, 

118 



and the enemy troops in the Philippines were containing the 
Filipino-American force in Bataan. Once the Japanese had 
conquered Singapore and the Indies, they reinforced their 
units in Luzon for a drive in overwhelming strength under 
General Homma [April 5, 1942]. 

The defenders of Bataan were worn out by short rations 
and sickness. They lived on carabao, monkey, and rice, and 
were at last forced to eat their horses and mules. At least 
twenty thousand men were disabled by malaria. Their only 
air cover was provided by a few Curtiss P-40s flying from 
strips cut out of the jungle. Since they lacked not only food 
and planes, but tanks and heavy guns as well, their fate was 
inevitable. Lieutenant General (now General) Jonathan M. 
Wainwright, who assumed command [March 17, 1942] after 
General MacArthur was transferred to Australia, rejected the 
first Japanese demand for surrender [March 22, 1942]. But 
when the enemy penetrated and outflanked his lines with 
overpowering strength [April 5-9, 1942], there were no 
means to sustain the delaying action in Bataan. All troops 
left on Bataan to cover the withdrawal to Corregidor sur- 
rendered [April 9, 1942]. 

Corregidor 

After overrunning Bataan, the Japanese mounted heavy 
guns in the mountains and directed a plunging fire at the 
forts of Corregidor. Planes and ships also bombed the be- 
leaguered garrison. Nevertheless, crowded as it was with the 
survivors of Bataan, the tunnels in the rocks scarcely habit- 
able, the main guns emplaced in the open without air pro- 
tection, still Corregidor held out for almost another month. 

Finally, opening their assault with a week of intensive 
bombardment by planes, ships, and artillery, the enemy 
swarmed across the narrow channel between Bataan and 
Corregidor and stormed the defenses at night. Corregidor 
and its three companion forts fell [May 6, 1942]. The Japa- 
nese terms were unconditional surrender. Soldiers, sailors, 
marines, and civilians, Filipino and American, became Japa- 
nese prisoners of war to the number of 11, 5 74 on Corregidor; 
36,853 had been captured on Bataan. The other islands also 
surrendered and were occupied by the enemy. The loss of the 

119 



Philippines was the sorriest defeat that this country ever 
suffered abroad, but as a delaying action the campaign was 
a success. Bataan and Corregidor, like Valley Forge, were 
triumphs of American courage: they promised that a war 
which began in defeat would end in victory. 

N etherlands East Indies 

As Japan's air and ground forces enveloped Southeast 
Asia, rolling up the British and American flanks in Malaya, 
Burma, and the Philippines, her land, sea, and air forces 
swept south through the Netherlands East Indies toward 
Australia and east across the Pacific Ocean toward the 
Hawaiian Islands. The Japanese caught the British, Ameri- 
cans, and Dutch off guard, or too poorly prepared to stop 
the onslaught, and hence did not need large forces to conquer 
an empire in the Pacific. Although the twenty-six divisions 
reportedly used in Japan's amphibious war outnumbered the 
Allied troops defending the Southwest Pacific, her victory 
was not due to superior numbers, but rather to speed, sur- 
prise, and the skill with which all arms were combined. Air 
power was basic, and the Japanese possessed it from the start 
in their "stationary island aircraft carriers" scattered through 
the Marianas and Carolines. To these bases they added 
others, extending their air power south and east. Under this 
air cover the Japanese Navy, divided into task groups, con- 
voyed amphibious forces to conquer and occupy all the 
strategic islands of the western Pacific. 

The Netherlands East Indies, scattered over more than 
fifteen hundred miles of water between Asia and Australia, 
and controlling the seas between these continents, offered the 
Japanese their richest prize. In Borneo, Sumatra, and Java, 
there was a wealth of oil, rubber, tin, quinine, hemp, and 
undeveloped iron and coal deposits, protected by a small co- 
lonial army of native troops, a miniature naval force, and 
a few planes bought from the United States. Only strong 
naval and air forces could have defended the Indies. The 
Japanese struck at them as soon as they established a base 
of operations at Davao, on Mindanao in the Philippines [De- 
cember 20, 1941], whence they had access through the Cele- 
bes Sea to the Strait of Makassar running between Borneo 

120 



and Celebes Islands and leading to Java. In addition, 
they invaded Sumatra from nearby Malaya, cutting the In- 
dies off from India in the north. From Truk in the Carolines 
they descended to New Guinea and the Solomons in order 
to close all waters in the south over which American rein- 
forcements might come from Australia. Thus while the In- 
dies were sealed off, the enemy was directing his main thrust 
at their heart, Java. 

The Japanese made preliminary landings [December 22, 
1941]', after a heavy bombing, on the northwestern coast of 
Borneo in the British protectorate of Sarawak, neutralizing 
submarine and air bases which threatened Japanese convoys 
to Malaya. Enemy bombers based on the Philippines then 
began to raid Dutch Borneo and Celebes [January 10, 1942], 
where they transferred planes to cover the passage of troops 
through Makassar Strait into the Java Sea. 

Java Sea Campaign 

As the Japanese moved south through Molucca and Ma- 
kassar Straits to conquer the Netherlands East Indies, Ad- 
miral Hart united with Admiral Helfrich of the Royal 
Netherlands Navy to stop the enemy with what American, 
Dutch, and Australian ships they could find. These weak 
forces fought a delaying action, attacking the Japanese four 
times with cruisers and destroyers, without air support ex- 
cept for a few Army bombers and fighters based on Java. 

The Battle of Makassar Strait [January 23, 1942], an 
attack on a Japanese invasion convoy lying off the coast from 
Balikpapan, Borneo, was the first major sea battle between 
the Allied nations and Japan. Under cover of night, four old 
American destroyers ran three times at top speed through 
an enemy invasion fleet in a daring torpedo attack. The 
Japanese did not know what had hit them. How many ships 
were sunk by Lieutenant Commander (now Commander) 
Paul H. Talbot's flotilla no one could count in the black 
night. When all their torpedoes were spent, the destroyers 
left the blazing sea in safety. Dutch and American bombers 
pounded the convoy and added to its losses. 

Though this convoy was stalled, nothing could stop the 
Japanese for long. Continuing eastward their forces landed 

121 



at Rabaul on New Britain [January 23, 1942] and at Bou- 
gainville in the Solomons [January 29, 1942]. They also 
seized new positions on the Borneo coast, captured the is- 
land of Amboina in the Banda Sea, and began to bomb Java 
[January 30-February 4, 1942]. Admiral Doorman led four 
cruisers and seven destroyers, Dutch and American, up 
through the Madoera Strait into the Java Sea [February 4, 
1942] to destroy another enemy invasion fleet gathering at 
Balikpapan. Japanese bombers intercepted this force, hit but 
did not disable the U. S. cruiser Houston and crippled the 
Marblehead. The Marblehead repaired first to Java and then 
limped home across nine thousand miles of ocean. Admiral 
Doorman could do no more to save Sumatra from invasion. 

When the enemy, having conquered Sumatra, Borneo, and 
Celebes, was ready to descend on Java, Admiral Hart relin- 
quished his command [February 11, 1942] to Vice Admiral 
Helfrich of the Royal Netherlands Navy, who made ready 
for a last desperate stand. American ships left Soerabaja 
[February 5, 1942], the Dutch naval base which was now 
exposed to constant bombing, for Tjilatjap on the southern 
coast of Java. To this port also came ships from Darwin, 
Australia, where the airports, docks, warehouses, and almost 
every ship in the harbor were destroyed in a heavy enemy 
air raid [February 18-19, 1942]. The Japanese closed in on 
Java from the southeast, landed on Bali, and seized the air- 
field. Admiral Doorman attacked them in Bandoeng Strait, 
inflicting considerable damage, but lost a Dutch destroyer 
and suffered injuries to two of his cruisers and another de- 
stroyer [February 19-20, 1942]. 

Desperate but futile efforts were made to hold Java, the 
richest island of the Netherlands East Indies and the last 
Allied base in the southern Pacific short of Australia. Enemy 
bombers sank the U. S. tender Langley [February 26, 1942] 
as she tried to reach Java with reinforcements of fighter 
planes. Admiral Doorman's force suffered severely in its last 
vain thrust at superior invasion forces off Soerabaja. [Febru- 
ary 27, 1942]. The Japanese sank two Dutch cruisers, two 
British and one Dutch destroyer, and disabled a British 
cruiser, the Exeter. The remaining ships were trapped m 
the Java Sea by Japanese naval or air patrols. Six warships, 

122 



including the Exeter, the American cruiser Houston and the 
destroyer Pope, headed for Soenda Strait. Only four Ameri- 
can destroyers escaped through Bali Strait to Australia. As 
the Japanese landed on the northern coast of Java [February 
28, 1942], ships at Tjilatjap evacuated the port hastily and 
steamed south for Australia. The American destroyers Edsall 
and Pills bury never made port. Against' overwhelming enemy 
strength and without air support these gallant vessels had 
fought in vain to hold the Java Sea, but the small Allied 
forces had first been split and then destroyed in detail. 

Fall of the Indies 

Japanese ground and air forces were not idle during the 
naval battles in the Java Sea. As the Dutch fired the oil 
wells of Borneo, the enemy seized Balikpapan to secure the 
Makassar Strait [January 22, 1942] , and came down through 
the Molucca Passage into the Banda Sea, landing on Ceram 
and Amboina [February 1, 1942]. Daily bombing raids 
which gradually neutralized the naval base of Soerabaja and 
other key points in Java grew more intense after the Jap- 
anese seized a convenient airfield on the adjacent island of 
Bali [February 18, 1942] . Other forces landed on Timor and 
cut Java off from Australia. [February 20, 1942]. To the 
north, Japanese parachutists followed by seaborne troops in- 
vaded southern Sumatra [February 14, 1942] the day before 
Singapore surrendered, overran the rich oilfields of Palem- 
bang, and drove the Dutch back upon Java. Having reduced 
Allied air strength on this beleagured island to a dozen 
planes, the Japanese sent amphibious forces under strong 
naval and air escort down through the Makassar Strait to 
land at three points on the northern coast of Java [February 
28, 1942]. They were quickly reinforced until the total in- 
vasion force exceeded one hundred thousand troops. With 
the surrender of Java [March 9, 1942], Tokyo announced 
the complete conquest of the Netherlands East Indies and 
the capture of ninety-eight thousand prisoners, of whor* 
some five thousand were British, Australian, and American 
Australia lay open to invasion. 



Japanese Penetration of the Southwest Pacific 

When General Douglas MacArthur reached Australia from 
the Philippines {March 17, 1942] to assume command of 
Allied defenses, the continent "down under" was being iso- 
lated by the Japanese sweep through the islands of the 
Southwest Pacific. Small amphibious forces of enemy ma- 
rines, often unopposed, seized points in New Guinea and 
the Solomon Islands to prepare the way for the invasion of 
Australia. Japanese carrier-based bombers softened up [Jan- 
uary 3-20, 1942] the defenses of Rabaul, on New Britain 
Island, which was conquered by a crushing defeat of the 
Australian garrison. On the same day [January 23, 1942] 
other enemy forces seized the centers of defense in the Solo- 
mons, Kavieng on New Ireland and Kieta on Bougainville. 
From these positions the Japanese struck west at New 
Guinea, bombing Madang, Lae, Salamaua, and Port Mores- 
by, and even neutralizing Port Darwin on the northern coast 
of Australia [February 19, 1942]. Enemy troops seized Lae 
and Salamaua [March 8, 1942] under blanket air cover, 
driving the Australians back toward Port Moresby. The later 
capture of Guadalcanal and Tulagi marked the high tide of 
their conquests in the Southwest Pacific. 

The timely arrival of American naval reinforcements halted 
the Japanese in this area and saved Australia. Supply lines 
to Australia, via Christmas, Canton, and the Fiji Islands, 
were established by American troops who landed, with the 
consent of the Free French, on New Caledonia and Espiritu 
Santo in the New Hebrides [March 12, 1942]. The decisive 
battles in the Coral Sea, first major victory in the war against 
Japan, stopped the advance of the enemy on Port Moresby 
and gave General MacArthur time to build up his forces for a 
counteroffensive. 

III. GUAM, V^AKE, AND MIDV^AY 

Two of the three American islands on the oceanic route 
from Hawaii to the Philippines fell to Japan. Guam, which 
the U. S. Congress had refused to fortify in 1939 for fear 
of provoking Japan, was an isolated outpost in the Marianas. 
Its garrison of some five hundred Americans made a brave 

124 



stand, but without planes or heavy artillery they could not 
throw back the enemy descending upon them in force from 
nearby Rota [December 11, 1941]. 

Wake, thirteen hundred miles closer to Pearl Harbor, was 
defended for sixteen days by a battalion of Marines and 
one thousand civilian workmen, who survived repeated bomb- 
ing and repulsed the initial attack by artillery fire at point- 
blank range. When the Navy radioed Major (now Lieutenant 
Colonel) James P. S. Devereux, to inquire what he needed, 
a message came back saying, among other things, "Send us 
more Japs." They came in force and overpowered the gar- 
rison [December 23, 1941]. This operation cost the invaders 
a cruiser, four destroyers, and a submarine, the heaviest toll 
ever paid by the Japanese in conquering so small an island. 

The fall of Guam and Wake cut off the American army in 
the Philippines from seaborne reinforcements, and all naval 
and air forces were thrown back four thousand miles across 
the Pacific to Midway, which is only fifteen hundred miles 
from Pearl Harbor. But Midway held. In the days following 
Pearl Harbor, the garrison of U. S. Marines twice repulsed 
a Japanese task force which attacked them. The Marines 
waited for the enemy ships to come within very close range, 
then opened fire with their shore batteries and sank a cruiser 
and a destroyer. Midway was saved. Six months later bomb- 
ers based there inflicted heavy damage on a second Japanese 
fleet invading these same waters. 

IV. U.S. NAVY ON TACTICAL OFFENSIVE 

Despite its heavy losses at Pearl Harbor, the U, S. Pacific 
Fleet was not immobilized. Following the decision made at 
Washington [January 3, 1942] by President Roosevelt and 
Prime Minister Churchill, to remain on the defensive in the 
Pacific until Hitler could be defeated in Europe, the U. S. 
Navy embarked on a vast holding operation with what ships 
it had. Any reinforcements of the Philippines or Nether- 
lands East Indies would inevitably be too little and too late 
to save them. At best, we could delay the Japanese advance 
and halt it short of the crucial defense line running diagonal- 
ly northeast from Australia to Pearl Harbor and thence north 
to the Aleutians. These Pacific outposts of the continental 

125 



United States must be held. To strengthen this Hne with 
bases, first for defense and later for offense, large supply 
fleets sailed to Australia under naval convoy. 

Raids on Japanese Islands 

While the Navy was on the strategic defensive, it never- 
theless assumed a tactical offensive, raiding Japanese out- 
posts to disperse their strength. Carriers and cruisers, 
grouped in task forces into which the Navy had divided its 
fleet, made swift jabs at the islands used by the enemy as 
"stationary aircraft carriers." The first raid [January 31, 
1942] was a heavy bombardment of the Marshalls and Gil- 
berts by a striking force of two carriers, one light and four 
heavy cruisers, and ten destroyers, under Vice Admiral (now 
Admiral) William F. Halsey, Tr. No vessels were lost, and 
enemy bases were damaged and weakened. 

Other blows followed, each delivered swiftly by carrier 
task forces built around the Enterprise, Yorktown, and Lex- 
ington, with their escorts of cruisers and destroyers striking 
the enemy islands one after the other. Such a force under 
Vice Admiral Wilson Brown was intercepted by enemy planes 
[February 20, 1942] before it could surprise the Japanese 
at Rabaul in New Britain. The Enterprise led a group of 
ships under the command of Admiral Halsey in the bombard- 
ment of Wake and Marcus Islands [February 24-March 4, 
1942]. The Lexington and Yorktown were spearheads of 
a force, again commanded by Admiral Brown, which raided 
the newly established enemy ,bases at Salamaua and Lae in 
New Guinea and sank several Japanese warships and trans- 
ports [March 10, 1942]. 

The First Tokyo Raid 

American morale was raised by a daring aerial raid on the 
main islands of Japan [April 18, 1942] foreshadowing the 
attacks which would be made by Superfortresses two years 
later. A task force under Admiral Halsey, which included 
two carriers, steamed to a position only eight hundred and 
fifty miles east of Tokyo. There sixteen regular B-25 Army 
land bombers took off from the Hornet, after a run of only 
eight hundred feet, to raid Japan. Colonel (now Lieutenant 

126 



General) James H. Doolittle, and his seventy-nine men flew 
close to the roof tops to avoid flak: at fifteen hundred feet 
they scattered sixteen tons of bombs and incendiaries on 
Tokyo, on the navy yard south of the city, and on other 
industrial cities. The Japanese were caught completely un- 
awares. Until their gas was used up the planes flew on, crash- 
landing in China, except for one which came down in Siberia. 
Of the eighty crew members, sixty-four returned in safety 
with Chinese help. Three pilots were put to death by the 
Japanese in violation of the customs of modern war. 

Battle of the Coral Sea 

The first battle between Japanese and American carrier 
planes in the Coral Sea [May 7-8, 1942] was also, as Ad- 
miral King reported, "the first major engagement in naval 
history in which surface ships did not exchange a single 
shot." The action came about when Rear Admiral (now Vice 
Admiral) Frank J. Fletcher's task force, covering Australia, 
broke up the Japanese advance into New Guinea and the 
Solomon Islands [May 3, 1942]. The Japanese occupied 
Florida Island in the Solomons where, in the prologue to 
the battle, planes from the carrier Yorktown sank and dam- 
aged a number of enemy vessels in Tulagi harbor [May 4, 
1942]. Then Admiral Fletcher's force joined American and 
Australian ships under Rear Admiral (now Vice Admiral) 
Aubrey W. Fitch; and their combined forces included two 
carriers, the Yorktown and Lexington, eight cruisers, and 
seventeen destroyers. 

These vessels watched for a probable seaborne invasion of 
Port Moresby and sailed northward to intercept the enemy's 
concentration of ships. In the Coral Sea, American planes 
spotted and sank the carrier Shoho [May 7 , 1942] and Jap- 
anese planes sank the destroyer Sims and a tanker [May 8, 
1942]. Two enemy carriers were severely damaged the next 
morning. Japanese planes counterattacked the two American 
carriers, scoring hits with bombs or torpedoes on both. Fires 
caused by explosions on the Lexington so disabled her that 
she had to be sunk by torpedoes from her own destroyers.

Despite the loss of this 3 3, 000- ton carrier, one of the four 
which were fightino: in the Pacific, the U. S. Navy won the 
Battle of the Coral Sea. The loss of fifty-five American planes 
and 543 men was far less than enemy losses in aircraft and 
personnel. The attempt to cut the Australian supply line was 
checked and the Japanese withdrew their naval forces north- 
ward. The U. S. Navy prepared for action in the Central 
Pacific, where an enemy thrust at American bases and com- 
munications would, if successful, open the way to Australia. 
Risks had to be taken in defending the South Pacific which 
were unjustified in the Central Pacific. 



18. TRAINING THE ARMED FORCES 

While the United States Navy held the supply lines to 
Australia and performed the initial naval mission in 1942 of 
screening the coasts of America, the Army was reorganized, 
expanded, and trained for its own crucial mission of defeat- 
ing all enemies. Only by bringing the war home to the 
Axis countries, on the ground and in the air, and breaking 
their will to resist by destroying their armed forces, could 
we defeat them completely. The strength of the Axis made 
it necessary for the United States to shoulder the heaviest 
burdens in this global war. Our allies had been a strong 
team when we joined them in 1917, but in 1941 the team 
was very weak. The United States would have to do more 
than in the last war, when they reinforced the French and 
British armies on the Western Front with two million in- 
fantry and artillery troops. The Air Force alone would de- 
mand two million men, and even larger Ground and Service 
forces would have to be mobilized, trained, and put into 
action on ten fighting fronts spread around the world. Above 
all, these needs had to be met quickly lest the enemy crash 
through a major front and win the war. Never before had 
the American people, a peace-loving people who had fought 
to secure their country and were now content to cultivate 
it, been called upon to do so much so quickly if they were 
to survive. 

128 



Reorganization 

To accomplish the greatest military task in its history, the 
United States Army was reorganized for the three main jobs 
of training "a huge citizen army" for combat, developing a 
strong air arm, and providing supply. A study of the problem 
had been undertaken nearly a year before Pearl Harbor by 
a group of officers under Lieutenant General Joseph T. Mc- 
Narney, later Deputy Chief of Staff. The Chief of Staff, Gen- 
eral George C. Marshall, the Secretary of War, Henry L. 
Stimson, and President Roosevelt accepted their recom- 
mendations [March 9, 1942]. The Army was to operate in 
three great commands, all under the direction of the Chief 
of Staff: the Ground Forces, charged with training field 
armies, under Lieutenant General Lesley J. McNair; the 
Air Forces under Lieutenant General (now General of the 
Army) Henry H. Arnold; and the Service Forces under Lieu- 
tenant General (now General) Brehon B. Somervell, respon- 
sible for all functions of the Army not under other commands 
or directly under the General Staff. In the General Staff it- 
self, an Operations Division, directed in turn by Major Gen- 
eral (now Lieutenant General) Leonard T. Gerow, Major 
General (now General of the Army) D wight D. Eisenhower, 
and Lieutenant General (now General) Thomas T. Handy, 
was organized for the strategic planning of war. The Opera- 
tions Division prepared plans for the Joint and Combined 
Chiefs of Staff and maintained contact with every theater of 
war. In the overseas theaters of operations the commanding 
generals had full responsibility for executing strategic plans. 
The War Department in Washington remained the switch- 
board of all communications, and everything continued to be 
done in the name of the Chief of Staff, assuring a proper cen- 
tralization of the war effort. Yet Ground, Air, and Service 
Forces, Operations Division, and the overseas theaters re- 
ceived sufficient authority to carry out their missions. 

Training Ground Forces 

The work of building an army fell to the Ground and 
Service Forces in the United States. The size of the job may 
be judged from the fact that in the defensive phase of the 

129 



war, from the middle of 1941 to the middle of 1943, the 
officer corps grew from 93,000 to 521,000 and the enlisted 
strength of the Army increased by five million men. Only 
14,000 officers came from the Regular Army; 110,000 were 
added from the Reserves, 21,000 from the National Guard, 
47,000 directly from civilian life, and most of the remainder 
from men selected from the ranks and trained in Officer Can- 
didate Schools. The number of general officers increased in 
much smaller proportion, from 343 to 1,065, of whom 910 
came from the Regular Army, all but 45 by temporary ap- 
pointment to higher grade. 

During the defensive phase of the war, in the two years 
following the summer of 1941, fifty new divisions were acti- 
vated, in addition to the twenty-eight infantry, four arm- 
ored, and two cavalry divisions with which we entered the 
war. To multiply units so fast, it was necessary to establish a 
cadre system. New divisions were built around units drawn 
from old divisions; some organizations were split several 
times to form the backbone of others. This method assured 
the efficient training of a rapidly growing army, but limited 
the number of units ready for early combat; for a division 
could not be quickly ripened until its cadre replacements 
were thoroughly seasoned. 

Almost as many different types of skill and training went 
into making the average infantry division of fifteen thou- 
sand men as a civilian community of the same number would 
demand. Only eight thousand troops were schooled exclu- 
sively for fighting. All the others had to be prepared to move 
the combat troops and their weapons and to sustain them 
on the field of action. Transportation, equipment, and supply 
demanded the services of over 1,500 men; communications, 
nearly an equal number; administration, 700; repair and 
maintenance of equipment, 450; the preparation of food, 
650; medical duties, 600; and a variety of other services 
occupied 1,600 men. All these troops were trained for com- 
bat, but nearly half of them were instructed in additional 
duties as well. 

Each American citizen inducted into the Army normally 
had a year of training divided into four three-month periods, 
during which he became a soldier, not only a fighting man 

130 



but one with special jobs to do in cooperation with others 
in closely knit organizations. During the first thirteen weeks 
of basic training at a replacement center he was taught the 
fundamental duties of a soldier. Less time was spent than 
in the last war on squad and parade-ground drill; of 572 
hours of basic training, only twenty were to be devoted to 
close-order work. In the second phase the soldier became a 
member of a division to study the tactics of his particular 
arm of the service, using what he had learned in ever larger 
units as he was trained with a platoon, company, battalion, 
and finally a regiment. Units of all arms were combined in 
the third phase to work together as a regimental combat 
team. The last quarter of the year's training was devoted to 
divisional field exercises and corps maneuvers. 

Beginning in March 1942, units selected for special com- 
bat operations rehearsed their assignments at the Desert 
Training Center, a Southwestern area of thirty thousand 
square miles resembling the sandy stretches of Africa; be- 
tween May and September others went to the Amphibious 
Training Center for Pacific operations, or the Mountain 
Training Center at Camp Hale in Colorado where the men 
encountered all the difficulties of mountainous Italy. Other 
grounds for large-scale corps maneuvers were carefully se- 
lected and organized in Tennessee, Louisiana, and Oregon. 
^'Battle indoctrination" prepared green troops to enter com- 
bat with seasoned enemies; under screens of live ammuni- 
tion fire they learned to overcome such opposition as they 
would meet in action. The result of all this graduated and 
specialized training was to make skilled workers of American 
citizens, able in one year to face enemies who had been 
trained troops for many years. The American became a vet- 
eran in his first battle. He did not need to learn by the cas- 
ualties of later battles what had been worked out by ex- 
perience of trial and error in training. Because of this realis- 
tic preparation for combat, lives were saved and battles 
were seldom lost. The American infantry of the last war went 
into the trenches after two months or half a year of training; 
in this war the infantry was better prepared to fight, for the 
plan was normally carried out of giving him a full year of 
training before overseas duty. 

131 



The Air Forces 

Many of the different arms required to win this war were 
developed almost from nothing. Among these, the United 
States Army Air Forces caught the public eye because of 
their spectacular expansion and deadly effectiveness all over 
the world. No other service grew so fast into an organization 
able to exploit the most complicated machinery of modern 
warfare. In nineteen years of peace only seven thousand 
pilots had been trained in aerial combat, and less than fifteen 
thousand men were skilled in the mechanics of repairing 
combat planes. Two years after Pearl Harbor, however, the 
Army Air Forces boasted over one hundred thousand pilots 
and half a million ground crew technicians, all graduates of 
an elaborate system of graded schools which taught more 
than a hundred different skills. At the School of Applied 
Tactics at Orlando, Florida, a postgraduate training ground 
which made use of all the lessons learned in combat, a com- 
plete air command flew bombers and fighters exactly as they 
must be operated overseas. 

Not only was Air Forces training thorough; it was inten- 
sive and fast, so that Americans were ready to take to the 
sky against the enemy before our Ground Forces could as- 
sume the offensive. The engineering troops who built, oper- 
ated, and defended airfields were a good example of Air 
Forces speed in training personnel. In 1939 the entire en- 
gineering strength of the Air Corps consisted of one officer 
and three enlisted men in the Aviation Section of General 
Headquarters. In June 1940, the 21st Engineer Regiment 
was transferred to the Air Forces and became the father of 
all the aviation engineer battalions. Twelve battalions were 
organized, besides the regiment, by the time of Pearl Harbor. 
Five months later, twenty were shipped to England, others 
to Panama, the Atlantic bases, and Hawaii. Exactly one year 
after Pearl Harbor, Air Forces engineers in England finished 
the first runways built in that theater entirely by Americans. 

Service Forces 

Another complex problem was that of providing for the 
range of professional and technical skills required by all the 
132 



tasks which fell to the Army Service Forces. Their work 
extended far beyond what was known in the last war as sup- 
ply. Men and women of the Service Forces were doctors, 
dentists, nurses, chaplains, lawyers, bankers, postmasters, 
teachers, storekeepers, clerks, cooks, mechanics, and police 
for the whole Army. The largest branches of the Service 
Forces, each with one or more training centers, were the 
Medical, Signal, Engineer, Quartermaster, Finance, Trans- 
portation, Ordnance, Military Police, and Chemical Warfare 
divisions. Practically all service troops were trained for com- 
bat, though not for the specialized fighting which was the 
principal mission of Ground and Air Forces. Combat engi- 
neers or signal units, for example, had to be prepared to 
carry on their work under fire and to engage the enemy if 
necessary. In 1944 despite the magnitude of service and 
supply here at home, half the manpower assigned to the 
Service Forces was overseas. 

For the 610 categories of work in the Army demanding 
specialized training, of which the larger number were service 
jobs, the American public schools provided an essential back- 
ground of general skills. The additional training necessary 
to develop a soldier who would also be a mechanic or a cook 
was furnished by a wide variety of service schools. For pro- 
fessional work at a high level the Army drew heavily on the 
graduates of American colleges and professional schools. The 
fact that a majority of the citizens inducted into service 
had gone at least as far as high school in their civilian edu- 
cation, a few years beyond the grade school average of sol- 
diers in the last war, added just so much to the military effi- 
ciency of the nation. It made possible an army which could 
work with machines and learn new jobs quickly. 

The final result of all training, the objective of the entire 
Army, was the defeat of our enemies overseas. The Army 
Service Forces, together with the Navy, transported the 
Ground and Air Forces with all their equipment to the battle 
fronts and sustained them in action. It is impossible in this 
brief account of a whole world at war to describe the rear 
areas, communications, and supply which supported every 
fighting front, but it cannot be forgotten that for every sol- 

133 



dier who fired a gun or flew a plane there had to be many 
more trained to back him up. 



19. THE BATTLE OF PRODUCTION 

For the United States the war was first of all a battle of 
production. With the largest industrial capacity of any na- 
tion in the world, American factories, mines, and shipyards, 
safely beyond the reach of enemy bombers, were expected to 
surpass the Axis and to equip not only our own fighting 
forces but also in part those of our allies. American manage- 
ment and labor, drawing upon rich natural resources and a 
highly developed technology, did not fail in their essential 
task. One year after Pearl Harbor the American production 
of war materiel was equal to the aggregate production of 
Germany, Italy, and Japan. Early in 1942, President Roose- 
velt asked for the manufacture of 60,000 planes and 45,000 
tanks in one year; by the end of 1942, American factories 
had turned out 48,000 military planes and 56,000 tanks and 
self-propelled guns. This was only the beginning. After two 
years of war, with American production steadily increasing 
and German production starting to decline under the impact 
of heavy bombing, the United States achieved industrial su- 
premacy both for itself and for its allies in the war against 
the Axis. No battle won on land, in the air, or at sea was a 
greater triumph than the victory of American supply, be- 
cause it made possible every success in combat. 

Since the United States was a greater industrial than mili- 
tary nation, stronger in supply than in armed forces, it fought 
a war of supply whose results were seen on all the battle- 
grounds of the world. Attacks both by land and sea were pos- 
sible because thousands of new cargo vessels and transports 
were quickly built and fitted to cross the Atlantic and Pa- 
cific. Warships, planes, and weapons from assembly lines in 
America helped to slow down and finally stop the advance 
of the Axis everywhere. Even before many American troops 
were in combat, American supplies were arriving at all Allied 
fronts. 

j Offensive operations were delayed until enough mechani- 

• 134 



cal and explosive power had been accumulated to crush the 
enemy with the least cost in men. The Soviet Union was 
forced to mass its men against the German armies sweeping 
through its land, because it had no other choice. The United 
States and Great Britain, whose shores the enemy never 
stormed, were thrifty in the use of manpower, lavish in sup- 
ply. 

The Defense Program 

Fortunately for the United States, in view of the sudden 
Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, we did not enter the war 
entirely unprepared. Under the program launched in 1940, 
Congress had voted appropriations of sixty-four billion dol- 
lars for defense. This huge sum exceeded not only the direct 
cost of the last war, which was estimated at thirty-two bil- 
lion, but even the entire national debt, which stood at forty 
billion in 1939. Before we entered this war, therefore, we 
were ready to spend twice as much as it took to win the last 
war. All this money, however, was not expended before Pearl 
Harbor. Only about one-sixth of the total appropriation had 
been used when war was declared, and of the amount spent 
nearly half had gone for new plants and equipment in the 
aircraft, munitions, shipbuilding, chemical, iron and steel, 
and machine tool industries. 

The chief gains in war production during 1941 were made 
in ships, planes, and tanks. Most industries were still busy 
getting ready to make what would be required for war. Yet 
production increased steadily. In the month of Pearl Harbor 
two thousand planes were manufactured, equal to the entire 
production of 1939. The output of tanks which had not been 
manufactured at all before the war, had risen to several hun- 
dreds. From 131 new shipyards, added to the old, came a 
ship a day by the end of 1941. In this year nearly three times 
as many keels were laid for warships as in the previous year. 
The Garand rifle was just getting into production with a 
daily output of 250 in the summer of 1940; these rifles were 
being made at the rate of a thousand a day one year later. 

As a result of the defense program we were far better pre- 
pared when Japan attacked us than when we entered the last 
war. In 1917 we had an army of 200,000 men, but in 1941 

135 



nearly that many troops were already in overseas garrisons, 
and our entire army numbered 1,800,000 men, partially 
trained and already housed in fifty cantonments. In 1917 
we had fifty-five military planes; in 1941 the Army Air 
Forces included two hundred incomplete squadrons. We also 
had the largest navy in our history, another navy being built, 
and half as many seagoing cargo vessels on the ways as our 
whole merchant fleet numbered in 1917. We were not pre- 
pared for Pearl Harbor, nor for global war on ten different 
overseas fronts, but we were ready to defend the continental 
United States and strategic parts of the Western Hemisphere. 
The defense program before Pearl Harbor was limited, 
chiefly because it operated as a supplement to our prosperous 
civilian peacetime economy. We prepared for war as we went 
to church, one day a week, and spent the other six days going 
about our private business. The Office of Production Man- 
agement [January 7, 1942], set up under William S. Knud- 
sen, had no power except to regulate Army and Navy pur- 
chases in competition with civilian production. A country 
which produced over three and a half million passenger auto- 
mobiles in 1941, at a time when all other great industrial 
nations had long since given up making autos for planes and 
tanks, could not expect to be fully prepared to fight its 
enemies. Americans would not give up their cars for guns 
until peaceful fellow citizens were bombed and shot at. 

Industrial Conversion 

Despite our previous reluctance to abandon "business as 
usual," within one year of the Japanese attack on Pearl Har- 
bar we were equaling the entire Axis in production for war. 
In 1942 we began to catch up with enemies who had a head 
start of ten years. President Roosevelt asked Congress [Jan- 
uary 6, 1942] to devote half of our national production to 
the "war effort" and submitted a budget for fifty-six billion 
dollars to be spent in 1942-43.^ For defense we had thus 
far spent only fifteen per cent of our national income; for 
war we must spend at least half of it. The President set high 
produ ction goals: 60,000 planes in 1942, 125,000 in 1943; 

^ The fiscal year of the Federal Government runs from July 1 in one 
year to June 30 the next year. 

136 



45,000 tanks in 1942, 75,000 the next year; and most aston- 
ishing of all, eight million deadweight tons of shipping in 
1942, although little more than a million had been built 
during the speed-up of 1941. "Only this all-out scale of pro- 
duction," declared the President, "will hasten the ultimate 
all-out victory. Speed will count. Lost ground can always 
be regained, lost time never. Speed will save lives, speed will 
save this nation." 

For speed and volume of production, over three-fifths of 
all the prime war contracts were awarded to one hundred 
large corporations. These giant concerns dealing in iron and 
steel, automobiles, chemicals, and ships did the lion's share 
of the work. But smaller business facilities were not neg- 
lected. Seventy thousand prime contracts and seven hun- 
dred thousand subcontracts were signed in 1942. Super- 
vising this work was the War Production Board [January 
13, iP42], established under Donald M. Nelson, with Charles 
E. Wilson appointed in September as vice-chairman to take 
charge of schedules. The automobile industry was converted 
to the manufacture of tanks, planes, and ordnance during the 
spring of 1942, when all automobile production was stopped 
and machines were retooled for war. In anticipation of the 
Japanese conquest of Malaya and the Indies, sources of the 
American raw rubber supply, the sale of tires was banned 
[January 1, 1942], and the armed forces were given priority 
in using the national stockpile of 600,00 tons, less than 
normal annual consumption; synthetic rubber plants using 
oil and alcohol products were erected. Some fifteen billion 
dollars of Government funds were poured into the expansion 
of all kinds of manufacturing plants, leased to private con- 
cerns, a capital outlay of over three times as large as private- 
investment in defense and one [June, 1940-September, 
1943] which gave the Government a considerable interest in 
American industry. Corporate profits were restricted by 
higher taxation and rising costs to the point where earnings 
of one thousand representative concerns in 1942, which had 
increased to seven and a half billion dollars, were only about 
five per cent of their sales and ten per cent of their net worth. 

A crisis in industrial conversion came in the fall of 1942, 
when production declined mainly because of the strategic 

137 



shift from defensive to offensive weapons. At the same time, 
Axis conquests had brought about shortages of certain raw 
materials; and inevitably complicated production schedules 
had caused some lines of goods to get ahead of others. The 
fact that we were making the shift to the attack was most 
encouraging, for it meant that American defenses were rea- 
sonably complete and that we were now able to carry the 
fight to enemies overseas. There were enough antiaircraft 
guns on hand to protect every town in America, and civilian 
defense was thoroughly organized against any possible bomb- 
ing raids; but ships, planes, and tanks in vast quantities 
were needed to prepare for overseas operations. Production 
of these weapons jumped again with the institution of a sys- 
tem of priorities and salvage which eased and directed the 
flow of raw materials. 

The Home Front 

Supply of vital materials was assured by the rationing of 
competitive civilian goods [April 11, 1942] under the direc- 
tion of the Office of Price Administration, with Leon Hender- 
son and later Chester Bowles in charge of some six thousand 
local boards of voluntary supervisors. The primary purpose 
of this agency was to stabilize prices at the levels of March 
1942, which were set as ceilings \ April 28, 1942] by the 
General Maximum Price Regulation in order to prevent 
an inflationary rise in the cost of living. Although prices 
rose in 1942, ten per cent at the wholesale level and twenty- 
two per cent for farm products, they did not climb out 
of sight as in the last war. From the summer of 1939 
to the end of 1942 it was estimated that the cost of living 
advanced twenty-one per cent; but in the period after Pearl 
Harbor, under price control and rationing, living costs in- 
creased only eight per cent. The high standard of living 
to which the American people were accustomed was never- 
theless maintained even with the added burden of war pro- 
duction. In 1942, for example, eighty-one billion dollars 
were spent by civilians . on food, clothing, rent and other 
necessities, an increase of six billion over the previous year. 
The national income after taxes, however, amounted to one 
hundred eight billion dollars, an excess of twenty-seven 

138 



billion, and this surplus of purchasing power over civilian 
goods and services available increased as the war went on. 
To some extent it was drained off by higher taxes and war 
bonds, which absorbed from one-tenth to one-fifth of the 
income of patriotic civilians, but it continued to threaten the 
economic stability of the country with an inflation of prices. 
A tremendous increase in agricultural production, despite 
shortages of labor and machinery, was stimulated by rising 
food prices. Over five million acres, nearly equal to all the 
land cultivated in California, were added to the crop area 
of the country in 1942. The result was a gain of twelve per 
cent in our food supply, making possible the shipment of 
almost four billion pounds of Lend-Lease foods to Britain 
and Russia in 1942 without stinting Americans in any way. 
Indeed, the millions of men in the armed forces who were 
withdrawn from useful labor in production and distribution 
were better fed than any equally large class of people in the 
world, and civilians with increased purchasing power had 
more to eat than ever before. Although the British brought 
seven million new acres into production between 1939 and 
1943, they remained dependent on American Lend-Lease for 
about one-tenth of their lean rations. This fraction was sup- 
plied with a great saving of shipping space by the dehydra- 
tion of eggs, milk, and other products, a process that also 
helped to feed the people in countries liberated from the 
enemy. In everything needed to support as well as to protect 
human life, America became the "Arsenal of Democracy," 
not on a wasteful or lavish scale but with the strategic 
economy required to win the war. 

Labor 

All this production depended on labor. The demands of 
total war were well illustrated by a poster which showed 
three men, the farmer, the laborer, and the soldier, marching 
side by side to victory. Only such harmony and cooperative 
effort could win the war. But conditions on the battle front 
and the home front were entirely different, and it was not un- 
natural that the strict discipline, self-sacrifice, and exclusion 
of all thought of personal profit necessary in military life 
should be wanting in civilian life. Unlike Britain and Russia, 

139 



the United States had adopted a Selective, not a National, 
Service Act. It was believed that efficiency at home would be 
better served by voluntary patriotism than by bureaucratic 
regimentation, which would be intolerable without the 
morale and esprit de corps uniting soldiers in the face of 
danger where their lives depended on never letting the other 
fellow down. 

Greater personal freedom rather than a higher standard of 
living distinguished civilian from military life. The American 
soldier was the best paid in the world. His basic weekly pay 
of $18.20, including an allowance for one dependent, was 
almost half the weekly average of $38.86 earned in factories 
in October 1042; and if to the soldier's money income were 
added the costs of feeding, clothing, and sheltering him, 
variously estimated at from twelve to eighteen hundred 
dollars a year, all of which a civilian had to provide for 
himself, military pay would be equal to or greater than civil- 
ian pay. The high wages earned in aircraft and shipbuilding 
plants, or in skilled machine trades, were not representative 
of the income of labor. Unless all civilians were to be de- 
prived of their freedom, assigned to jobs by military order, 
and reduced to a uniform level of living, the monetary 
incentives of a peacetime economy remained the chief 
stimulus to maximum production. 

On December 23, 1941, the leaders of eleven million 
workers, organized in labor unions, voluntarily gave up their 
legal right to strike. This pledge was conditional, however, 
because it was understood that nothing would be done to 
decrease union membership and that prices should not be 
allowed to rise out of proportion to wages. A National 
War Labor Board was established [January 12, 1942] under 
William H. Davis to cooperate with the Office of Price Ad- 
ministration in stabilizing wages and prices. The War Labor 
Board wrote maintenance of union membership clauses into 
many collective bargaining agreements. When C.I.O. (Con- 
gress of Industrial Organizations) steelworkers demanded an 
increased wage of one dollar a day because of increased 
prices, the War Labor Board granted a raise of forty-four 
cents under the so-called Little Steel formula which be- 
came the national wage policy. This decision was an attempt 

140 



to put "an end to the tragic race between wages and prices" 
by raising the former fifteen per cent [October 3, 1942] to 
catch up in cases of lag with an equal rise in the cost-of- 
living index since January 1941. By Executive Order of the 
President all wages and salaries under five thousand dollars 
were frozen, but Congress refused to adopt his other recom- 
mendation that all net incomes, after taxes, be limited to 
$25,000. 

Although rising prices continued to provoke strikes, the 
record of American organized labor was better in this respect 
than in the last war; if threefold allowance be made for the 
larger American population, it was as good as the record of 
British labor. There were never as many strikes in the 
United States during any year of this war as there were in 
1918 and 1937. No strikes were authorized by the American 
Federation of Labor or the Congress of Industrial Organiza- 
tions. Aside from the coal strikes called four times in 1943 
by the United Mine Workers under John L. Lewis, involving 
over four hundred thousand miners each time, the average 
number of days lost per worker in all strikes steadily de- 
clined during the war. In 1939 fifteen days were lost for 
every worker; in 1941, ten; in 1942, five; and in 1943, 
except for the coal strike, three days. 

Despite all the exaggerated publicity which strikes re- 
ceived, a much more serious problem for management was 
the high rate of turnover and in some industries of absentee- 
ism. The War Manpower Commission under Paul V. McNutt 
was assigned the task of overcoming labor shortages and 
adjusting the competitive demands of industry, agriculture, 
and Selective Service for manpower. When scarcity of labor 
developed in thirty-five industrial areas, the War Manpower 
Commission gave these centers priority, and required all 
labor to be hired through the United States Employment 
Exchanges [December 5, 1942] ; in order to prevent one 
employer from robbing another, war plants were encouraged 
to train four million people in new skills. 

The serious gap created in the supply of labor by the 
withdrawal of seven, and later of eleven, million men for the 
armed forces was filled by increasing the number of hours 
worked each week from an average of forty to forty-eight, 

141 



with overtime pay, and by employing women to replace men. 
Some four million women were added to the ranks of in- 
dustrial labor in 1942 and 1943, making a total of nearly 
seventeen million women, as compared with thirty-four mil- 
lion men, in the battle of production. Unemployment, the 
plague of peacetime economy, was almost wiped out by war 
industry. When the defense program was adopted in 1940, 
there were seven million unemployed ; four years later all but 
a million had been absorbed in an expansion of the labor 
force, bringing the total number fully employed to an all- 
time high of sixty-five million people. 

Volume of Supply 

The efforts of labor, combined with the directive skill of 
management, the rich natural resources of the United States, 
and the immense credits afforded by its people, won the 
battle of production. The credits, unfortunately, were debits, 
an increase of present spending power to be charged against 
the future. From June 1940 to the end of 1943 the United 
States actually spent one hundred fifty-three billion dollars 
for war purposes, nearly five times the cost of the last war. 
The national debt had risen, by June 1944, to a little over 
two hundred billion dollars, forty of which was pre-war debt. 
These figures indicate that the American people were borrow- 
ing against future income to pay for the war, financing it 
largely through loans rather than taxes. 

The consumption of natural wealth in war production can- 
not yet be estimated, but it has been extraordinarily heavy 
in high-grade iron ore, zinc, copper, and accessible oil, vital 
industrial resources which cannot be replaced. The skill of 
management and the genius of invention have been apparent 
on every hand. Typical was Henry J. Kaiser who had built 
Boulder Dam but never a ship. By standardizing and pre- 
fabricating parts, he turned his shipyards into assembly 
plants, and cut the time for delivering a Liberty ship from 
nearly two hundred days to less than forty, so that a cargo 
vessel arrived in Australia fifty-one days after its keel had 
been laid in Portland, Oregon. The miracle worked in ship- 
building may be judged from the fact that the combined ship- 
yards of the nation turned out a vessel a day in 1942; two, 

142 



and then three, ships a day in 1943; in the latter year mer- 
chant ships totaling nineteen million tons were launched arxi 
warships totaling two and a half million tons. 

All records made in war production during 1942, which 
have been cited earlier, were surpassed in 1943. With full em- 
ployment and expanded war plants the American people pro- 
duced 29,500 tanks, over 22,000 motor carriages for self- 
propelled artillery, 47,000 scout and armored cars, 830,000 
machine guns, 5,500,000 rifles and carbines, and 172,000 
guns above 20mm. in caliber. During the first nine months of 
1943, American shipyards delivered 1,429 merchant vessels 
of more than 15.000,000 tons. The production of heavy 
bombing planes reached a rate of one thousand a month in 
November 1943, and six months later, over eight thousand 
planes of all types were being turned out every thirty days. 
Never before had such overwhelming superiority in armament 
been achieved so quickly. 

Mass production gave the United States the greatest air 
and tank forces in the world. In four years [July 1, 1940- 
September 30, 1944] our factories built 70,000 tanks and 
232,403 airplanes. The aircraft were composed of the follow- 
ing types: 74,953 bombers, of which 25,000 were four-en- 
gined planes; 70,627 fighters; 54,642 trainers; 17,592 trans- 
ports; and 10,785 planes for communications; 2,345 for navai 
reconnaissance; and 1,459 for special purposes. 

Mighty as America was in war production, the contribu- 
tions of the British Empire and the Soviet Union to the com- 
mon cause were also great and indispensable in defeating the 
Axis. Russian figures have not yet been released, but anyone 
may guess at j:heir staggering size by comparing the Lend- 
Lease totals of what the United States has sent Russia with 
the far greater need of her enormous armies in three years of 
warfare on fronts extending over a thousand miles. The Brit- 
ish Empire had produced, from the beginning of the war in 
1939 to the end of 1943, 90,000 aircraft; 83,000 tanks, 
armored guns, and gun-carriers; 1,000,000 vehicles; 115,000 
heavy guns; and 5,500,000 machine guns, rifles, and pistols. 
In 1943. the United States and the British Empire together 
manufactured over fourteen planes every hour of the day and 

143 



night, a total of 127,000 aircraft. The combined production 
of the United Nations defeated the Axis in the battle of pro- 
duction. 



20. THE BATTLE OF THE ATLANTIC 

A month after Japan struck at Pearl Harbor, Nazi U-boats 
appeared off the eastern coast of the United States to renew 
the Battle of the Atlantic. A well timed attack threatened 
American shipping, without which the military power of this 
country was limited to its own shores, for while Japan drew 
our supply lines far out into the South Pacific, Germany tried 
to cut off the supply and reinforcements of our Allies in 
Europe. The submarine offensive was designed to destroy 
Lend-Lease supplies going to Britain, Russia, and the Middle 
East, and to defeat this country before it could arm and hit 
the enemy. The main attack of the Axis in the spring of 1942 
was not in Europe but off the Atlantic coast of the United 
States, where U-boats proved far more deadly than in the last 
war. With a surface speed of twenty knots and a cruising 
range of twelve thousand miles, improved submarines lurked 
off American ports for three weeks at a time. U-boats made 
concentrated raids not only on coastal shipping but also on 
convoys crossing the Atlantic, entering the Mediterranean, 
and sailing the northern route to Murmansk in Russia. 

American Coastal Shipping 

The enemy undersea raids were most effective along the 
Atlantic coast. U-boats were continuously on patrol, concen- 
trating first off Cape Hatteras, then Florida, and finally at 
the extremes, the Caribbean Sea and the St. Lawrence River. 
They attacked between dusk and dawn at high surface speed. 
At one time, they drove coastal oil tankers from the sea, and 
gasoline rationing went into effect in the seaboard states in 
May 1942. War goods piled up on East Coast docks, backed 
up at inland war plants, and on one occasion forty thousand 
military trucks stood at an eastern port waiting for ships. 
American defenses were overstrained because a one-ocean 
Navy was spread between the Atlantic and Pacific, coordina- 

144 



tion with Army Air Forces was new, and there was a lack of 
small craft, submarine chasers, destroyers, radio or sonic de- 
tectors, and of trained crews to operate them. In the first ten 
months of 1942 the newspapers reported the sinking of 201 
American merchant ships, most of them from March through 
July, and a total loss of 498 Allied and neutral ships. 

To defeat the U-boats the United States organized and 
manned sea frontiers along the Atlantic coast, in the Car- 
ibbean, and on the Gulf of Mexico, with new air and naval 
patrol bases for civilians as well as regular craft. All kinds of 
small boats were pressed into service, and the lights of coastal 
cities were dimmed, browned, or blacked out [May 14, 1942]. 
Finally the trans-Atlantic convoy system was operated close 
to our shores. From Florida to Maine, coastal ships herded 
together under guard of naval escorts, sailed only during day- 
light, and took refuge at night in ports or at anchorages pro- 
tected by minefields. This adaptation of oceanic submarine 
defenses to home waters slowed up transportation but de- 
feated the U-boats, and sinkings off the Atlantic coast de- 
clined sharply. As the U-boats moved south and north to 
easier hunting grounds of the Caribbean, the Gulf, and the St. 
Lawrence, the convoy system followed them [July 1, 1942]. 
Supplementing the convoys, a great force of Army, Navy, and 
civilian planes, together with small craft from the Navy and 
Coast Guard, scoured the seas for U-boats hiding in ambush. 
The submarines were driven out to sea, first to the coasts of 
South America, then to West Africa, and finally to the Cape 
of Good Hope. Coastal waters became safer in the middle of 
1942, but the high seas remained dangerous. Throughout the 
year total shipping losses exceeded new shipbuilding. 

Lend-Lease Convoys to Russia ' 

The North Atlantic route to Murmansk and Archangel was 
the shortest to Russia but the most dangerous for cargo ves- 
sels, even in convoy, because the Nazi attacked them from a 
chain of air and U-boat bases around the north of Norway. 
Both merchant and warships were scarce because so many 
were needed to buoy up defenses in the Pacific and Middle 
East. As a result too little shipping was available for Russian 

145 



supply, and too few warships could guard cargoes from Bos- 
ton and Philadelphia, main ports for Russian Lend-Lease, on 
the perilous voyage to Murmansk. 

The Nazis attacked these convoys with packs of U-boats 
northeast of Iceland, as they approached Norway, and with 
bombers from the North Cape to Murmansk. It was a run- 
ning battle all the way. At one time 350 Nazi bombers 
swooped on a great convoy, and sank many ships before the 
raiders withdrew after losing forty planes. As the Arctic night 
turned into day during the spring and early summer, from 
March to July of 1942, the Murmansk-bound convoys suf- 
fered their worst losses. About one-fourth of all the ships 
from American and British ports which ran this gauntlet in 
1942 went to the bottom. In addition two British cruisers and 
ten destroyers were sunk, and many other warships were put 
out of action for months by Nazi bombs. 

Nevertheless, from the time Russia was attacked in 1941 
to the end of 1942, nineteen Allied convoys made Murmansk 
or Archangel. After the number of escorting warships went 
as high as seventy-five for a single convoy, more and more 
supplies reached Russian battlefields. By the fall of 1942 new 
highways and railroads were made ready in Iran to handle 
traffic over the safer route from the Persian Gulf, and the 
bottleneck of Russian Lend-Lease supplies was broken in time 
to help equip the Red Army for its offensives after Stalingrad. 

The Fight Against the U-Boat 

For both Britain and the United States it was essential to 
win the Atlantic from Nazi submarines. "We British," said 
Churchill in Parliament [June 8, 1943], "must continue to 
place the anti-U-boat war first, because it is only by conquer- 
ing the U-boat that we can live and act." The United States 
in turn could act with military power in Europe only after 
the Atlantic was made safe for convoys. 

Early in 1943, when it was reported that the German rate 
of submarine building reached a peak of twenty U-boats a 
month, the Nazis were believed to have altogether four or 
five hundred in service. To destroy this fleet and the facilities 
for its replacement, British and American naval and air 
forces accelerated their work of destruction. Flying Fortresses 

146 



did great damage to the German submarine yards at Vegesack 
in March, and heavy daylight raids were made on the con- 
crete sub-pens at coastal bases in occupied France, but these 
bombings had little appreciable effect on U-boat operations. 
American shipyards, on the other hand, launched in May a 
growing fleet of destroyer escorts and escort carriers, the lat- 
ter known as "baby flat-tops." Planes from these escort ves- 
sels followed convoys all the way across the Atlantic, pounced 
on U-boats before they could submerge, and broke up the 
under-sea wolf-packs. 

The turning point in the protection of convoys came in 
May 1943 when thirty or more U-boats were sunk. In that 
month we wiped out the net increase in U-boats for the pre- 
vious three months and were beginning to reduce the basic 
fleet itself. In May, June, and July an average of one sub- 
marine a day was sent to the bottom. In August, September, 
and October a total of sixty was sunk. Over two hundred 
U-boats were sunk in 1943; and from the beginning of the 
war to the middle of 1944, a total of more than five hundred 
was destroyed. Through the summer no Allied merchant ship 
was torpedoed in the North Atlantic ; even the Mediterranean 
Sea was comparatively safe. Of some 2,500 vessels used in 
the invasion of Sicily, only eighty thousand tons were lost. 
By the middle of 1943 the Allies had three million more tons 
of shipping than at the start of the year. 

The U-boats were offset by increased shipbuilding and 
the combined strength of Allied air and surface convoys. At 
last we had power enough to protect the growing fleet of 
supply vessels and to drive the packs of U-boats to cover. 
Destroyers, corvettes, and baby flat-top aircraft carriers did 
the work. Typical was the action which began with an attack 
by eight submarines on a large convoy in mid-Atlantic [May 
1-3, 1943]. The escort fought them off; but for three days a 
gale slowed the convoy down and other submarines came in 
for the kill. As soon as the weather cleared, a pack of twenty- 
five made thirty torpedo attacks in three days and nights. 
Escort planes and corvettes sank four, probably six more, 
and dispersed the rest [May 4-6, 1943]. As escort carriers 
increased through the summer, they never let the under- 
water enemy get within fifteen miles of- a convoy. In August 

147 



another battle with a pack of thirty U-boats went on for 
three days, but the enemy was kept out of torpedo range. 
The Atlantic Ocean, thanks to the convoy system, had again 
become Anglo-American waters, a good supply line from 
America to Britain. 

In the two and a half years from Pearl Harbor to the in- 
vasion of Europe, the American and British navies escorted 
seven thousand ships across the Atlantic with the loss of only 
ten while under convoy. For American and British naval 
patrols the middle of the Atlantic was made the dividing line. 
Convoys, however, setting out from the United States with 
American naval escorts kept their guards, with British re- 
inforcements, until they reached overseas ports. In addition 
to operating this convoy system, Admiral Royal E. Ingersoll, 
commanding the U. S. Atlantic Fleets, maintained a striking 
force to meet any heavy German units which might pene- 
trate the western Atlantic. 

Naval Actions, 1939-1941 

Important naval actions marked the first two years of the 
war in the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. The 
Royal Navy fought to control these waters against German 
surface raiders and the Italian Navy, and to neutralize the 
French warships left in African ports after the surrender of 
France. 

The German pocket battleship. Admiral Graf Spec, a fast, 
heavily armored cruiser of 10,000 tons, with six 11 -inch 
guns, designed to outshoot or outrace its opponents, was 
tracked down in the South Atlantic by two light and one 
heavy British cruisers and severely damaged in battle off the 
coast of Uruguay [December 13, 1939] . After making re- 
pairs in the neutral port of Montevideo, the German captain 
scuttled his ship rather than run the gauntlet of British cruis- 
ers lying offshore [December 17, 1939] . 

The British suffered a serious though temporary loss of 
naval power in the evacuation of Dunkirk when seventy de- 
stroyers of the Royal Navy were damaged and put out of 
action by German air power. The transfer of fifty over-age 
American destroyers to the British Navy more than restored 
the loss of ships at Dunkirk. 

148 



When France surrendered to Germany, Admiral Darlan 
assured Great Britain that the French fleet would not fall 
into Hitler's hands. But the British took no chances with 
French ships stationed in African ports. British naval forces 
destroyed or disabled most of the squadron at the French 
North African base of Oran after its commander had ignored 
an ultimatum to surrender \July 3, 1940]. The French 
squadron at Alexandria, Egypt, agreed to be neutralized. 
The British, supporting the Free French, disabled a French 
battleship at Dakar on the West African coast when Gen- 
eral Charles de Gaulle vainly attempted to seize the port 
with Free French troops [July 8, 1940]. 

With the remainder of the French fleet bottled up at 
Toulon, the British undertook to contain the Italian Navy 
in the Mediterranean. Italian battleships and cruisers were 
damaged on three occasions \November 11, 27, December 
14, 1940] by British torpedo planes raiding their bases in 
Sardinia, and at Taranto and Naples in Italy. Finally, the 
British caught two Italian squadrons off Cape Matapan 
[March 28, 1941]; naval gunfire and planes from the car- 
rier Formidable damaged one battleship and sank three 
cruisers and two destroyers. After this engagement the Italian 
Navy remained in hiding. 

The German battleship Bismarck, the most powerful war- 
ship afloat in 1941, with eight 15-inch guns and a heavily 
armored hull, designed with so many water-tight compart- 
ments as to be almost unsinkable, caused great alarm when 
she broke out into the Atlantic in the late spring of 1941. 
Intercepted by British vessels in the Denmark Strait between 
Iceland and Greenland, the Bismarck fired a salvo which sank 
the Hood, a lightly armored, much older ship of 37,000 tons 
[May 24, 1941]. After a chase back across the Atlantic 
toward the French coast, the Bismarck was first brought to 
bay by torpedoes from carrier planes, which slowed her 
down and wrecked her rudder, and was then sunk by aerial 
torpedoes, gunfire from two British battleships, the Rodney 
and Kin^ George V, and still more torpedoes from the 
cruisers Sheffield and Dorsetshire [May 26-27, 1941]. Other 
enemy air and naval actions durin.f? 1941 resulted in the crip- 
pling or sinking of four British battleships, three carriers, and 

149 



seven cruisers. Some of these losses occurred off Crete. The 
damaged vessels were all repaired in American ports under 
the Lend-Lease Act. 



21. THE OLD WORLD GIVES THE NEW 
TIME TO PREPARE 

Americans were actually at war two years before they 
could train and equip a large army, build the largest navy 
and air force in the world, and join their allies in major 
offensives against both Germany and Japan. The United 
States began to arm for defense during the year and a half 
of peace, between the fall of France and Pearl Harbor. 
While Great Britain, Yugoslavia, Greece, and Russia kept 
Hitler busy in Europe, Lend-Lease and Selective Service 
were getting under way. Once we were in the war, our first 
moves had to be defensive; even the campaigns in North 
Africa and on Guadalcanal were relatively minor blows, 
more defensive than offensive. Meanwhile our attempt to 
check the enemy's advance on all fronts was immeasurably 
strengthened by the long lines which the Red Army held in 
eastern Europe. Here the Germans attacked with their great- 
est masses of manpower and materiel, taking ground at heavy 
cost, only to lose it again to the indomitable Russian armies. 

I. RUSSIAN COUNTEROFFENSIVE, 1941-42 

In the first winter of the war in Russia, the Nazis went 
into defensive positions. The German generals had wanted 
to do this before snow fell and the vain drive on Moscow 
extended their lines, but Hitler had refused to listen to them. 
His first conflict with the army came to a head when he re- 
lieved Field Marshal Walther von Brauchitsch of supreme 
command [December 21, 1941] and declared that henceforth 
he would follow his own "intuition." He was no match for 
''General Winter." Nazi troops in summer clothing perished. 
Soviet guerrillas cut their supply and communications lines. 
The bitter cold froze the lubricating oil and cracked the 
cylinders of engines in tanks, planes, and trucks. Supply and 
transport broke down over the vast distances which had been 

150 



overrun but not conquered. Nevertheless, the Nazis dug into 
Russia as if to stay. They began repairs on the great power 
plant at Dniepropetrovsk, reclaimed mines, distributed steam 
tractors through the Ukraine to speed production of food 
for their armies, and altered the railroad gauge for German 
rolling stock. Conscript Poles and prisoners of war were put 
to work building lines of defense in the rear. The Germans 
reversed the positions of the old Stalin Line west of the 
Dnieper and finished lines along the Bug and Oder rivers 
which had been started over a year before. 

Estimates of Casualties 

The Russians took the offensive because they thought that 
the Nazis were poorly prepared to weather the winter. 
They were also convinced that Nazi reserves had been ex- 
hausted by heavy casualties. On this score the Russians 
were mistaken. The rest of the world, like the Germans, 
wondered if it was not the Soviet Union which was exhausted. 
This idea was equally false. Moscow acknowledged total 
casualties of 2.122,000, and this figure may be accepted as 
a minimum. The Germans claimed that they counted 3,806,- 
000 Russian prisoners in their cages. Even if only half this 
number were military prisoners, the Red Army must be 
able to find trained reserves for its winter offensive among 
the eleven million available men of Russia. As for Axis losses, 
Moscow claimed that 3,500,000 were killed in the invasion. 
The Nazis, even after the winter was over, admitted the 
death of only 251,291. These figures were clearly absurd. 
They probably lost no less than 1,200 a day (the rate of loss 
at the height of the Battle of France) throughout the in- 
vasion of Russia. But such losses were partly offset by the 
annual German levy of 700,000 conscripts and the recruiting 
of Hungarian and Rumanian forces. 

Red armies in the north, center, and south each under- 
took a winter campaign to relieve Leningrad, to free Moscow, 
and to raise the siege of Sevastopol. During the winter the 
Russians fought their way westward to regain a strip aver- 
aging 120 miles in width, but never penerated the enemy's 
main line of resistance. While the counteroffensive fell short 
of its chief objective, it proved that the great German of- 

151 



fensive had also failed, for the Russian armies were so far 
from being destroyed that they could turn upon the invader 
in full force. 

Support of Leningrad 

The northern campaign to free Leningrad began with a 
two-pronged drive westward on either side of Lake Ilmen 
toward the enemy railroad center of Pskov [December 15, 
1941]. The upper prong pierced the Spanish 11th Infantry 
Division, which Franco had sent to Hitler's aid, but failed 
to do more than create a deep salient. The southern prong 
advanced much farther and encircled three divisions of the 
German Sixteenth Army at Kholm and Staraya Russa which 
nevertheless maintained their hedgehog defenses through the 
winter with supplies from the air. Leningrad was not effec- 
tively relieved, but it was kept alive under siege by "The 
Road of Life" built across the ice of Lake Ladoga. Over this 
road in the long winter nights crawled columns of trucks 
loaded with food and munitions to arm the hard-pressed peo- 
ple of Leningrad. 

Failing to raise the siege of Leningrad, the Red Army 
turned upon Finnish forces north of the city in an effort to 
regain control of the railway from Murmansk [January 8, 
1942]. Through this northern port, British and American 
Lend-Lease tanks and planes were beginning to flow into 
Russia. The Finns held their grip on the strategic railroad, 
and all foreign imports continued to be routed via Soroka 
over the longer rail line from Archangel. 

Moscow Breathes 

On the central front the Red Army massed strong forces 
along a line 170 miles to free Moscow and the industries 
of Tula from the dangerous pincers which the enemy had 
thrust part way around the capital [December 15, 1941]. 
Both Nazi salients were wiped out. To the north the Rus- 
sians took Klin and Kalinin, and struck west to cut the 
railway at Velikie Luki; to the south they reconquered the 
Tula area and created a bulge below Smolensk. In the cen- 
ter all attacks fell short of the enemy bastions of Rzhev and 
Vyazma. Likewise an attack on Smolensk from positions 

152 



above and below the city was unsuccessful. Farther south 
Timoshenko crossed the Donets River and drove a wedge 
into enemy lines below Kharkov. But nowhere during the 
winter did the Red Army penetrate the enemy's main line. 
All the Nazi strongpoints, Staraya Russa, Rzhev, Vyazma, 
Orel, Kursk, and Kharkov, held. 

Defeat in the Crimea 

The Russian winter offensive in the south was an elaborate 
operation to relieve Sevastopol, still besieged by Manstein 
[December 29, 1941]. The Russians made landings on the 
eastern and southern sides of the Kerch Peninsula, where 
the unsuspecting enemy had withdrawn most of his forces 
and resistance was light. Kerch and Feodosiya fell. Then a 
Russian force of fifty thousand landed north of Sevastopol at 
Eupatoria [January 7, 1942]. Manstein summoned re- 
serves to defeat these forces, overwhelmed the enemy at 
Eupatoria [January 10-13, 1942], and then moved quickly 
eastward to take Feodosiya [January 19-21, 1942]. The 
Russians retired into the Kerch Peninsula, to be reinforced 
until their numbers reached two hundred thousand [March 
13-28, 1942]. Even then their furious attacks were futile, 
and Manstein finally crushed them with tanks and planes 
[May 7 , 1942], attacking along both coasts of the peninsula, 
piercing the front line, and encircling with combined arms 
units as far to the east as Kerch itself. The Russians trapped 
between Parpatsch and the northern coast fought desperately 
to break out [May 11, 1942]. Some divisions withdrew to 
make a stand on the heights before Kerch, but the city fell 
[May 15, 1942] because no adequate defense could be im- 
provised. In this struggle the Nazis claimed to have annihil- 
ated nineteen divisions and seven armored brigades, and to 
have captured 150,000 prisoners. 

Fall of Sevastopol 

The German victory on the Kerch Peninsula left the 
Russians only one position in the Crimea, the great naval 
base of Sevastopol. It was said by the German press to be 
the "strongest single fortress of the world," not only because 
its rugged terrain was cut up into sharp hills and deep ra- 

153 



vines, but also because the Red Army had heavily strength- 
ened its ancient defenses. There were nineteen modern forts, 
hewn out of rock, four levels deep, with 11 -inch guns in 
battleship turrets, all protected by hundreds of pillbo^jes 
and thousands of land mines. A garrison of 125,000 soldiers 
and marines under General Petrov defended Sevastopol, and 
all but two hundred of the civilian population of 85,000 were 
evacuated. The Red Army proposed to endure siege, for if 
this toehold in the Crimea could be maintained, the Black 
Sea would remain Russian and the German right wing in 
Russia might be pinned down short of Rostov and the 
Caucasus. 

Manstein attacked the outer fortification of the city [June 
2, 1942] from the north and east with two hundred thou- 
sand troops while Richthofen's air fleet and heavy artillery 
attempted to pierce the defenses in a narrow sector in order 
to reach the interior forts quickly. After five days of intensive 
artillery preparation, however, the northern line anchored 
at Fort Maxim Gorki still held. Ten days later when its 
magazines blew up, Gorki fell and German infantry occupied 
the northern shore of the harbor which divides Sevastopol. 
Their enfilading fire assisted forces from the south in taking 
the hills of Inkerman east of the city [June 28, 1942]. Then 
a night landing was made on the southern shore and a pincers 
attack ended the siege with the capture of Fort Malakhoff. 
Sevastopol was occupied, but resistance did not cease. Fi- 
nally, the seventy thousand troops, who had withdrawn south 
and east of the city to the Khersonese Peninsula, failed to 
find any ships for evacuation and were trapped into sur- 
render [July 2, 1942]. 

The Germans succeeded at Sevastopol for two reaons. 
Their air fleet, jumping in waves from one front to another 
and flying continuously in support of ground troops, was 
greatly superior to the local Russian air force. Nazi planes 
made 25,000 sorties and dropped 125,000 heavy bombs. 
Above all, heavy artillery fired on the forts 30,000 tons of 
shell, fifty tons every hour, day and night, for twenty-five 
days. After this torrent of bombs and shells no steel or con- 
crete could resist the massed assaults of infantry. 

154 



Mousetrap below Kharkov 

To forestall a Nazi summer offensive, Marshal Timoshenko 
attacked the enemy south of Kharkov with thirty-four divi- 
sions [May 12, 1942]. His plan was to draw off enemy re- 
serves, spring a major drive farther south from Izyum, and 
recover the Dnieper Bend by a sweep on Dniepropetrovsk. 
His initial attack in the form of two wedges made great 
progress, but Kharkov did not fall, nor were enemy reserves 
committed to its defense. 

Instead Bock surprised Timoshenko by a powerful coun- 
teroffensive which caught the main Russian forces at Izyum 
[May 17, 1942]. Nazi 88mm. batteries neutralized Russian 
tanks, and the Izyum hedgehog was encircled from the south. 
Armored spearheads surrounded the Russian forces west of 
the Donets. Timoshenko 's advance elements were almost 
annihilated, and by his own admission he lost 70,000 men. 
The Germans claimed over 240,000 prisoners. The Russian 
army on the Kharkov front faced the enemy summer offen- 
sive with depleted forces, and Timoshenko was transferred 
to a new command. 

This defeat did not undo the work of the Russian winter 
offensive. The Nazis could not start forward in 1942 where 
they had left off in 1941. They had lost men as well as 
ground, and Russian armies had killed more troops than 
"General Winter." The fighting in Russia never stopped for 
long, summer or winter; lines never stabilized. The Red 
armies had turned blitzkrieg into a war of attrition. 

II. ROMMEL ADVANCES INTO EGYPT 

The Germans had been halted in Russia, but they re- 
newed their drive in the Middle East. Four times since 1940 
the tide of war had swept back and forth across the Libyan 
sands, but this struggle for possession of Egypt and the Suez 
Canal came to a crisis in 1942. Through the spring months 
the British and German armies fought a battle of supply 
in Libya, and without American shipments Egypt might 
have been lost. In the course of two years, up to June 1942, 
the British Empire and the United States sent to the Middle 
East the bulk of their men and materiel: 950,000 men, 

155 



6,000 planes, nearly 5,000 guns, 4,500 tanks, 50,000 machine 
guns, and over 100,000 vehicles. These men and weapons 
were transported, not through the Mediterranean, but over 
ten thousand miles of water around Africa and up the Red 
Sea to Egypt or over a 9,000-mile air route from the United 
States via Brazil. Despite these great distances the British 
accumulated many more tanks and planes than the Axis 
could assemble in the Middle East. 

Here, as elsewhere, the Axis had the advantage of short 
interior lines, but most of its supplies went to prepare a 
new offensive in Russia, and what could be spared for Africa 
had still to run the gauntlet of British planes from Malta. 
By continuous raids with a force of over six hundred planes 
the Luftwaffe tried to wipe out the garrison at Malta, and 
early in 1942 reduced its aerial strength to twelve fighter 
planes. British and American aircraft carriers, notably the 
Wasp, rushed in reinforcements, however, to keep the island 
a thorn in the side of the Axis. Malta was the key to the 
offensives launched in Libya by both the Germans and the 
British in 1942. The Germans aimed for Tobruk to gain a 
supply port free of interference from Malta, and the British 
sought to give the island air cover from Africa by advancing 
as far as Derna. 

RommcVs Second Offensive 

Rommel launched his offensive first by surprising the 
British with feints in the north and center of their Gazala 
defenses [May 26-27, 1942]. Then he enveloped the Bir 
Hacheim minefields, southern anchor of the line, and de- 
stroyed a brigade which deployed its superior tanks in de- 
tail [May 31 1942]. But Rommel advanced so far and so 
fast that the British surrounded him in a pocket which their 
troops named the "Cauldron." Here his situation was desper- 
ate, and minefields in the rear cut off retreat. Nevertheless, 
he broke open a corridor to the west for reinforcements and 
annihilated a brigade which tried to close the gap [June 
5-9, 1942]. The British wasted their preponderance of tanks 
and artillery in scattered counterattacks, and the German 
threat to their communications finally compelled them to 
evacuate Bir Hacheim and withdraw from the Gazala line. 

156 



Then the British ran into a fatal ambush which robbed 
them of all their strength. On Black Saturday [June 13, 
1942] in a decisive battle at Knightsbridge, Rommel lured 
British armor, concentrated for once, into the deadly fire 
of his massed 88mm. guns and destroyed all but sixty-five 
of three hundred tanks. This disaster hurled the British 
back into Egypt. British and American bombers covered the 
retreat and saved it from becoming a rout [July 1, 1942]. 
For fear of envelopment, however, the British could not stop 
short of El Alamein. Here they stood, only seventy-five miles 
from Alexandria, blocking a corridor which stretched for 
forty miles from the Mediterranean to the Qattara Depres- 
sion. A South African division was left in Tobruk to hang 
on Rommel's extended supply lines, as in 1941, but the gar- 
rison of twenty-five thousand men surrendered to his sud- 
den assault [June 21, 1942]. Altogether the British lost over 
eighty thousand troops in this campaign. 

Stand at El Alamein 

Rommel's men, however, were too short of water and sup- 
plies to break through at El Alamein. The timely arrival 
[July 1-3, 1942] of planes, tanks, and reinforcements at 
Suez helped the British to maintain defense in depth. 

Several counterattacks [July 14, 22, 27, 1942] failed for 
want of coordination; and in August General Sir Harold 
R.L.G. Alexander replaced General Auchinleck in command 
of the Middle East, as General (now Field Marshal) Sir Ber- 
nard L. Montgomery took over General Ritchies' Eighth 
Army. Before the British forces could reorganize, Rommel 
renewed his offensive and penetrated twenty miles east of El 
Alamein. Here he ran into minefields and lost over half his 
tanks as he swung north to cut up the British rear. Since 
Rommel could not repair these losses, with long-range Amer- 
ican Mitchell bombers taking increasingly heavy toll of his 
Mediterrnaean supply line, Egypt was safe. Hitler's main 
armies were committed to the invasion of southern Russia 
and the Caucasus at this time, and there was little to spare 
for the Afrika Korps. When the British forces were again re- 
cruited in October, Montgomery was to launch the attack 

157 



which would drive the Germans out of Egypt and Libya to 
destruction in Tunisia. 

Lend-Lease Wins the Battle of Supply 

During the summer of 1942, while Rommel's forces still 
threatened El Alamein, the battle for Egypt was still a battle 
of supply. It was a race between Montgomery and Rommel 
to see who could gain superior power. The Axis had a head 
start with short supply routes from Italy into Africa, but 
all its supplies had to run the gauntlet of British and Amer- 
ican bombers which took heavy toll of Axis shipping. 
Through the summer, the U. S. Ninth Air Force, based at 
Cairo, helped the British in raids against Axis supply routes. 

America and Britain won the battle of supply. Bombers 
flew across the Atlantic. Fighter planes were shuttled across 
the South Atlantic by aircraft carriers, from whose decks 
they took off within range of the African coast and flew the 
rest of the way across the desert to Egypt. By October 23, 
when General Montgomery was ready for the final Battle of 
El Alamein, more than seven hundred twin-engnie bombers 
and one thousand fighters had reached Africa from the 
United States. With this air support the British Eighth 
Army blanketed Rommel's forces, cut off German supplies, 
and destroyed the Luftwaffe in Egypt. 

The tanks which the Eighth Army needed, after losing 
most of its machines in Rommel's trap and falling back to 
El Alamein, came by sea, together with guns, munitions, 
and trucks. The voyage from the United States around the 
Cape of Good Hope took seventy days, and from England 
nearly as long. When one of the supply ships making this 
voyage was torpedoed, with fifty-one tanks and twenty- 
eight self-propelled guns aboard, an American armored di- 
vision on maneuvers in the United States was stripped of 
tanks to replace those lost at sea. For the Battle of El Ala- 
mein, General Montgomery had nine hundred medium tanks, 
including over three hundred M-4 General Shermans. In 
addition, twenty-five thousand trucks and jeeps arrived for 
the supply services which were to follow in pursuit of Rom- 
mel to Tunisia; to cripple Nazi tanks, came ninety of the 
new American 105mm. self-propelled guns. With this arma- 

158 



ment, produced by American factories and shipped through 
Lend-Lease, the British won the Battle of El Alamein and 
saved the Middle East. 

III. NAZI ADVANCE TO THE CAUCASUS, 1942 

The Nazis renewed their long-expected offensive in Russia 
early in the summer of 1942 with an overwhelming superiority 
in tanks and planes built up through the winter. For this 
offensive 240 divisions of three million men were assembled, 
according to Stalin; in addition to 179 German divisions, 
there were 22 Rumanian, 14 Finnish, 13 Hungarian, and 10 
Italian divisions, one from Spain, and another from Slovakia. 
It was a limited offensive, directed southeast toward the oil- 
fields of the Caucasus, and not as in 1941 to the annihilation 
of enemy forces along the entire front. Evidently the Germans 
were too weak or too wise to repeat the massive maneuvers 
of the invasion year. They had learned that the USSR, unlike 
Poland and France, could not be knocked out in six weeks, 
or even in six months, and they clearly did not plan another 
such attempt. The new plan, however, was no less grandiose. 
If they could penetrate southern Russia to the Volga and win 
the oil of the Caucasus, they could eventually cripple the 
Red Army, and be in position to strike at the Middle East or 
join hands with the Japanese in India. In either case, they 
would divide the British Empire, separating the eastern from 
the western half, cut off Russia and China from British and 
American supplies, and isolate the United States from its 
allies before its forces could reach any fighting front. Thus 
the hope that both Britain and Russia might be defeated in 
the Caucasus dictated Hitler's Napoleonic strategy. 

Advance to Voronezh 

Marshal Bock opened the summer offensive with a cam- 
paign on the Kharkov front, designed to cut the Moscow- 
Rostov railroad, separate the opposing armies of the center 
and south, and secure the line of the upper Don. His forces 
moved east 150 miles to Voronezh and threw the Russians 
into a general withdrawal [June 10, 1942]. The attack began 
with an envelopment of the bridgehead north of Kharkov, 

159 



and from this point the offensive spread along the whole 
Kharkov front. [June 24, 1942]. With air support, Nazi 
tanks drove fifty miles into the rear at Kupyansk and forced 
the Russians to retire from the upper Donets [June 26, 
1942]. Then the main offensive became continuous north to 
Kursk. Three columns, each spearheaded by a tank division 
and covered by waves of dive bombers, plunged one hundred 
miles toward Voronezh [June 28, 1942]. The Red Army 
lacked reserves to fill the gaps and was pressed in retreat by 
overwhelming Nazi air fleets [July 2, 1942]. As German 
tanks crossed the Don at Voronezh, the infantry mopped up, 
taking more than eighty thousand prisoners [July 7, 1942]. 
This advance compelled the Russian forces left below in 
the Donets Bend to retreat to the Don. The Germans as- 
sumed a tactical defensive north to Bryansk, with the upper 
Don railroads in their hands, and shifted the offensive south- 
east. Ever since the fall of Sevastopol had secured their right 
flank along the Black Sea, they had been preparing this 
sweep to the Caucasus. 

Penetration of the Caucasus 

Three armies moved southeast through the Donbas, two 
on Stalingrad and another on Rostov and the Caucasus. 
Kleist's army captured Rostov on the Don [July 25, 1942] 
for the second time by outflanking the city from the north 
and using air power to crush fierce ground resistance. A tank 
thrust to Salsk [July 31, 1942] forced the Russians to retire 
south of the Don. The capture of Rostov and Salsk, cutting 
both railroads leading into this region, isolated the defenders 
of the Caucasus. Nazi armored divisions from Rostov circled 
north [August 3, 1942] to seize Voroshilovgrad in the Don- 
bas, and turned south again to join other units on a swift 
drive into the Kuban, 120 miles below Rostov. The Red 
Army abandoned Krasnodar and all of the Kuban [August 9, 
1942], evacuating troops through the Black Sea naval port 
of Novorossisk, and this base fell after a brief siege [Septem- 
ber 11, 1942]. German efforts to deny the Russian Navy its 
last base at Tuapse, however, were frustrated by the defenses 
of west Caucasia. 

160 



Nazi forces plunged south into the Caucasian highlands to 
capture the Maikop oilfield [August 8, 1942]. They detoured 
roadblocks and ambushes on the military highways and 
caught the Russians in the rear of the strongpoints chosen for 
a defensive stand. But the higher they climbed into the 
Caucasian passes, at altitudes between five thousand and ten 
thousand feet, the more determined was Russian resistance. 
The Nazis slowly penetrated to Mozdok, sixty miles from the 
great Grozny oilfield, whose capture would have won them a 
quarter of all the Soviet's oil. 

The fighting in the Caucasus Mountains was as savage as 
the country was rugged. The Nazis hurled their tanks in 
spearheads of one hundred to one hundred and fifty at each 
highland objective, but the Russians broke these attacks 
with self-propelling 76mm. antitank guns massed in regi- 
mental strength. Although the defenders of the Caucasus 
were isolated, the struggle at Stalingrad helped them to hold 
out because it absorbed enemy reserves and supplies. In the 
Caucasus no less than at Stalingrad, the Red Army fought to 
hold each strongpoint to the end. As winter came on, the 
enemy was finally halted at Ordzhonikidze {November 10- 
19, 1942], where the Georgian military highway runs through 
the mountains down to Tiflis and Iran. The invaders failed 
to capture the oil of Russia or to cut Russia off from theLend- 
Lease supplies coming in through Iran. 

Sweep to Stalingrad 

Meanwhile the Nazis reached out across the Donbas to 
Stalingrad and the Volga River. The armies of \'on Paulus 
and Schwedler made a concentric advance from the west to 
conquer the brown steppes between Voronezh and the Cau- 
casus. As the Russians fell back northeastward on the Don, 
saving their tanks and planes, the Sixty-Second Army under 
General Chuikov fought stubborn delaying actions \July 22, 
1942]. In the south, Schwedler's army reached the Don on a 
front of one hundred miles around Tsimlyansk where they 
were delayed by fleets of Red planes which destroyed bridges 
as fast as the Germans could build them. During this delay 
the Russians concentrated an army below Stalingrad to check 

161 



the Nazis swinging north upon the city from Kotelnikovski. 
The enemy flung his right arm eastward to Astrakhan, and 
the lower Volga was now within range of the Luftwaffe. Un- 
der constant bombing, beginning August 25, Stalingrad was 
reduced to ruins, but the Russians made strong defensive 
breastworks of their fallen homes and buildings. 

In the north the German Sixth Army under General Von 
Paulus drove between two Red armies, advanced 125 miles 
in six days \July 19-25, 1942], and from three sides attacked 
the Don bridgehead at Kalach, west of Stalingrad. Resistance 
was so fierce that more than two weeks of continuous bomb- 
ing by Richthofen's air fleet was required to take Kalach 
\July 27, 1942]. In this battle the Axis claimed the capture 
of 57,000 troops and one thousand tanks. Then Paulus turned 
north to Kletskaya where a Red army had launched a diver- 
sionary attack on his rear \ August 2, 1942]. Another bitter 
battle ensued \ August 14, 1942], carried on day and night, 
until Nazi tanks pushed a wedge between the defenders and 
all counterattacks failed. 

Both Nazi armies were now across the Don and converging 
on Stalingrad fortv miles away [August 17, 1942]. Bock 
mounted the assault in three great columns, as he had done 
the year before at Moscow, strongly supported by the Luft- 
waffe which was concentrated on this front. The northern 
column broke through [August 23, 1942] to the Volga River 
a few miles above Stalingrad, cut the city off from the north, 
and reduced its communications to one railroad beyond the 
river. By engaging this advance column, the main Russian 
forces which had retreated northeast of the Don saved the 
city from envelopment. Meanwhile the Nazi columns from 
Kalach and Kotelnikovski in the west and southwest drove 
the Russians steadily back on lines of tank traps and pill- 
boxes prepared for the defense of Stalingrad [August 31 — 
September 14, 1942]. But the "meat-grinder" of Chuikov's 
Sixty-Second Army gave General Yeremenko time to prepare 
the city for siege and to bring up sufficient reserves to hold it. 
When a Nazi tank column charged into Stalingrad and cap- 
tured the height of Mamai Kurgan (Hill 102) [September 
14, 1942], the 13th Guards Rifle Division of General Ro- 

162 



dimtsev, under cover of Soviet artillery across the Volga, 
stormed it in bloody and unsuccessful assaults. The siege of 
Stalingrad, an industrial center of some 600,000 people, was 
on. Stukas and artillery lashed at the city, but the defenders 
held. Here along the broad sandy ridge beside the Volga, 
Hitler was doomed to waste his forces as he had wasted them 
at Moscow.

PART FIVE 

UNITED NATIONS TURN 
THE TIDE 

22. THE UNITED STATES HALTS JAPAN 

In three years of naval war in the Pacific we passed, ac- 
cording to Admiral King, from the defensive to the offensive 
in four stages. Pearl Harbor threw us entirely on the defen- 
sive to protect our own shores and lines of communications. 
This initial phase [December 7, 1941-May 8, 1942] was 
marked by desperate engagements, such as the battles in 
Makassar Strait and the Java and Coral Seas, and the raids 
on the Marshalls, Gilberts, Tokyo, Salamaua, Lae, and Tu- 
lagi. In air of these operations our forces were either inferior 
to the enemy or gained superiority only by limiting their 
action to surprise raids. 

The Battle of Midway [June 3-6, 1942] was a critical 
defensive-offensive operation in which the defeat of Japanese 
invasion forces gave us once more the balance of naval power 
that had been lost at Pearl Harbor and allowed us to seize 
the initiative from the enemy. 

It was followed by a year of offensive defense [August 7, 
1942-August 6, 1943], beginning with the landings at Guad- 
alcanal and ending with the naval battles in the Kula and 
Vella Gulfs, during which our forces fought chiefly to defend 
their small gains, recruit their strength, and mount supply 
bases for the future offensive. In this phase, as at Midway, 
the enemy advance was definitely halted and his counter- 
attacks against our forward movements were defeated. 

Finally, with the capture of Tarawa and Makin, we at last 
entered upon the fourth phase [November 1943-1944], a 
sweeping offensive by land, sea, and air, to penetrate the 
defenses of the Japanese Empire, reconquer the great islands 
lost to the enemy's lightning war in 1942, and to reach the 
China coast. Our naval superiority and well stocked advance 

164 



bases in the Pacific gave us the power, as Admiral King said, 
"to attack the enemy at places of our own choosing." 

I. THE BATTLE OF MIDWAY 

The naval war in the Pacific changed from passive de- 
fensive to active defense with the Battle of Midway [June 
3-6, 1942]. It was the first decisive defeat inflicted on the 
Japanese Navy in 350 years. Southwest of Midway Island 
in the Central Pacific, about fifteen hundred miles beyond 
Pearl Harbor, a Catalina flying patrol sighted a large enemy 
force. It proved to be part of a giant armada of at least 
eighty-eight ships, including four battleships and five car- 
riers, with a convoy of fourteen transport and supply vessels, 
all divided into three groups, a striking force, a reserve, and 
a landing force. The strength and course of these fleets indi- 
cated that their mission was to conquer not only Midway 
but also bases in the Hawaiian Islands. 

The foray into American waters, the greatest ever under- 
taken by the Japanese, found our naval forces deployed in 
the area between Midway and the Aleutian Islands. Orders 
went out to make ready all available ships but in these first 
months after Pearl Harbor we could muster only three carri- 
ers, including the Yorktown, which had been recalled from 
the Coral Sea and hastily repaired, seven heavy cruisers, one 
light cruiser, fourteen destroyers, and about twenty sub- 
marines. These vessels were divided into two task forces un- 
der Rear Admiral (now Admiral) Raymond A. Spruance and 
Rear Admiral (now Vice Admiral) Frank J. Fletcher. 

Even before the Navy could get within striking range, 
Flying Fortresses from the Marine base at Midway bombed 
the enemy transports which had been first sighted [June 3, 
1942]. Following the heavy bombers, came Catalinas fitted 
out with torpedoes which probably sank a transport in the 
first night torpedo attack in American naval history. Next 
morning over one hundred Japanese bombers and fighters 
struck at Midway in a raid which cost them forty planes and 
failed to destroy the base. 

The enemy aircraft had come from a carrier group which 
was spotted two hundred miles northwest of Midway and 

165 



immediately attacked by twenty-six Army, Navy, and Ma- 
rine torpedo planes and dive bombers. The Navy was still 
three hundred miles east and unable to provide fighter pro- 
tection. The Midway planes dropped a thousand-pound bomb 
on a battleship, three more on a carrier which burst into 
flames and smoke, and sent one or two torpedoes into another 
carrier. This attack was delivered through such a heavy 
curtain of antiaircraft fire and Zero fighters, that only one 
of the six Navy planes and eight of Major Loften R. Hender- 
son's sixteen Marine dive bombers returned to Midway. 

As the American carriers came into range, swarms of 
planes flew to the attack and stung the enemy into retreat. 
The Hornet's Torpedo 8 Squadron of fifteen planes found 
four enemy earners and went in without fighter protection to 
score a hit. Only one pilot survived. From the Yorktown and 
Enterprise twenty-six more torpedo planes, followed by dive 
bombers, put two enemy carriers out of action, damaged a 
third which was sunk later by submarine, and hit a battle- 
ship and cruiser. From their only undamaged carrier, the 
Hiryu, Japanese planes stopped the engines of the Yorktown 
and set her afire with three bombs and two torpedoes. The 
Yorktown was sent to the bottom by her own destroyers two 
days later, after an enemy submarine had hit the crippled 
ship twice with torpedoes [June 6-7, 1942]. Planes from the 
Enterprise avenged her loss by leaving the Hiryu in flames. 

The American carrier-based planes won control of the air 
in the first day of battle, and the dive bombers developed by 
the Navy proved their power. On the second day of battle, 
Flying Fortresses from Hawaii joined with the carrier planes 
and those from Midway and helped bomb two battleships, 
three cruisers, a damaged cruiser, and a destroyer. The Japa- 
nese turned tail and ran for home in thick weather. Dive 
bombers from the Hornet and Enterprise found one group 
and hit four cruisers and a destroyer. The Navy pursued the 
enemy westward until shortage of fuel and losses in aircraft 
forced ships and planes back to Pearl Harbor. 

Midway was another battle like' the Coral Sea in which 
planes did all the fighting and warships did not exchange a 
single shot. The aerial victory was overwhelming. Losses 

166 



suffered by the enemy were the heaviest of any sea-and-air 
battle in the war. Four carriers, the Kaga, Akagi, Soryu and 
Hiryu, the heavy cruiser Mikuma, and three destroyers were 
sunk; three battleships, three heavy cruisers, one light cruiser, 
and several destroyers were damaged; 275 aircraft were de- 
stroyed; and the enemy lost at least 4,800 men. American 
losses were relatively light: the carrier Yorktown of 19,900 
tons; a destroyer, the Hammann; about 150 planes; and 
307 men, chiefly from the Army and Navy air units. The 
battle of Midway removed any enemy threat to Hawaii and 
the West Coast from the Central Pacific, restored the balance 
of naval power in the Pacific which had been lost at Pearl 
Harbor, and confined the Japanese henceforth to home wa- 
ters and to the South Pacific, except for their short stay in 
the Aleutians. The news was the best to reach Americans 
in 1942 and was to be equaled only by the British and 
American landings in North Africa and the Russian victory 
at Stalingrad. 

Distance and Supply in the Pacific War 

While Japan fought along interior lines radiating south 
from Tokyo for about three thousand miles, the United 
States defended the Southwest Pacific at the end of ex- 
terior lines stretching seven thousand miles from San Fran- 
cisco. The war in the Pacific was therefore a problem in 
logistics, the science of planning military movements. To 
advance one mile on the road to Tokyo consumed not only 
days and nights of fighting but months of supplying. The first 
two years of the Pacific war were largely spent in establish- 
ing supply lines and bases from which the offensive could be 
launched against Japan. 

The distance from American west coast ports to Australia 
is so great that convoys, sailing at the speed of the slowest 
ship, made the voyage out in seventeen to twenty-five days. 
A fighter plane, which flew at four hundred miles an hour 
within two hundred miles of its base, could not get into the 
combat range until it had first been ferried across the Pacific 
Ocean on a freighter making but fifteen miles an hour. 
From the speeded-up assembly lines in American factories, 
every plane of this type faced a month of inaction before 

167 



it took off against the enemy. The same delay applied to 
all men and materiel, and was actually extended by the 
number of men and volume of supplies required to defend 
the Southwest Pacific. Every division of fifteen thousand 
ground troops sent into the Pacific combat theaters required 
thirty thousand service troops for supply and transport. One 
soldier on a transport needed eight tons of shipping space to 
reach the battlefront fully equipped and one ton of supplies 
every month after his arrival to keep him in action. 

After the fall of the Philippines and the Netherlands East 
Indies the Allied forces were thrown back on Australia for 
their main base in the Pacific. Australia was not only farther 
from the United States than were England and Africa, the 
main bases in the Atlantic, but also much less convenient 
for military operations. Although the Australian continent 
is about as large as the United States, it has a population 
of only seven million, with little manufacturing and no oil, 
railroads of different gauge in each state, limited highways 
except on the southeast coast, and no large harbor except 
Sydney on the east coast. Through the middle of 1942 there 
was a desperate rush to protect its northern shore around 
Port Darwin from Japanese occupation, and to connect this 
outpost by rail and highway with the cities and ports of the 
southern and eastern coasts. From Australia northward to 
the combat zones in New Guinea and the Solomon Islands 
there was another stretch of more than a thousand miles. 
In these tropical areas, which lacked railroads, warehouses, 
or docks, advance bases had to be won from the enemy and 
converted into supply ports during 1942 and 1943. 

II. GUADALCANAL AND BUNA 

When the Japanese offensive against Australia was first 
thwarted in the Battle of the Coral Sea [May 7-11, 1942], 
the enemy did not retire from the Southwest Pacific. Having 
occupied most of New Guinea to flank Australia from the 
north, he developed air bases in the Solomon Islands which 
threatened American supply lines to the Australian continent. 
It was imperative for American forces, however weak, to pro- 
tect both Australia and its supply lines; otherwise there 
would be no springboard closer than Pearl Harbor from 

168 



which a counteroffensive could be mounted against Japan. 
The want of men and ships in the Pacific kept the United 
States on the strategic defensive through 1942. But tactically 
offensive measures were taken by American and Australian 
troops against the most advanced enemy positions in the 
Solomons and New Guinea. These operations became famous 
as the campaigns of Guadalcanal and Papua, long, hard 
battles in which Americans first defeated the Japanese in the 
tropical jungles of the Pacific. 

Landings at Guadalcanal 

Guadalcanal, an island eighty miles long and twenty-five 
miles wide, lay seven hundred miles south and east of the 
Japanese base at Rabaul. A thousand miles farther south, the 
American base at New Caledonia was threatened by an air- 
field which the enemy was building on Guadalcanal. To deny 
its use to the Japanese, amphibious task forces were quickly 
organized under Vice Admiral Robert L. Ghormley with 
headquarters at Auckland, New Zealand. 

The 1st Marine Division, reinforced with elements of the 
2nd and under the command of Major General (now 
General) Alexander A. Vandegrift, was assigned the task 
of taking and holding Guadalcanal and adjacent areas. Their 
landings [August 7, 1942] caught the Japanese by surprise, 
but the opposition on Florida, Tulagi, and other nearby 
islands to the north of Guadalcanal was vigorous and stub- 
born. On the larger island of Guadalcanal the Japanese fled 
without offering opposition. However, they would undoubt- 
edly fight to regain the airfield which the Americans had cap- 
tured. Our troops took up positions from which to defend 
their prize. 

The Japanese began striking back with air power the first 
day and brought naval vessels into action the second night 
after the landings. The U. S. and Australian units screening 
our transports were surprised near Savo Island between 
Florida Island and Guadalcanal. The action was over in 
half an hour, costing us the cruisers Canberra, (Australian), 
Quincy, Vincennes, and Astoria, and badly damaging 
the Chicago and the destroyers Talbot and Patterson. Only 
' the fact that the Japanese Navy retired north leaving us at 

169 



least temporary control of the waters between Guadalcanal 
and Florida, gave some assurance that we might hold what 
we had just gained. 

The naval defeat began the contest to see whether we 
or the Japanese could build up the greater weight of rein- 
forcements and supplies on Guadalcanal. The advantage of 
land-based ziircraf t was with the Japanese at first jince their 
bases in Rabaul were closer than ours in New Caledonia. 
By holding the airfield on Guadalcanal, however, and com- 
pleting it so that our aircraft might use it, we hoped to 
reverse that advantage. About ten days of strenuous labor 
by engineers made the field usable for small planes, and a 
fighter squadron was brought in. Japanese reinforcements 
had arrived — ^about a division were landed by the end of 
September. As these began to come in, they and those who 
had fled at our landing attempted to drive the Americans 
from positions about the airfield. But the Marines turned 
back every attack with extremely heavy Japanese casualties. 

In the meantime, the Navy had taken partial revenge for 
its earlier defeat near Savo Island. Assisted by planes from 
Guadalcanal and Army bombers from more distant bases, 
aircraft from the carriers Saratoga and Enterprise badly 
damaged a Japanese carrier and several destroyes and made 
hits on another carrier, a battleship, several cruisers, and 
other vessels [August 23-25, 1942]. In the days^that fol- 
lowed we in turn lost the carrier Wasp and five destroyers; 
while the Japanese lost the carrier Ryujyo. The ''Tokyo Ex- 
press," a Japanese destroyer ferry bringing reinforcements 
and supplies from Bougainville to Guadalcanal, now began 
to make nightly runs which threatened to build up a ground 
superiority that would overwhelm the Marines defending the 
airfield. 

Battle for Henderson Field 

To prevent the Japanese from gaining the advantage on 
the ground, elements of the Americal Division were sent in 
October to reinforce the Marines, and the rest of the division 
came in during the following two months. At the same time 
that these first reinforcements were nearing Guadalcanal, 
U. S. cruisers and destroyers under Rear Admiral Norman 

170 



Scott intercepted one of the Tokyo Express runs near Cape 
Esperance [October 11, 1942]. The accurate gunfire of the 
U. S. cruisers Boise, Salt Lake City, Helena, and San Fran- 
cisco sank the carrier Kinugasa and four destroyers. As the 
airfield improved and more Navy, Army, and Marine planes 
arrived, Henderson Field, as we renamed the strip the Japa- 
nese had started, played a larger part in the battle. By the 
time the battle of Cape Esperance was fought we had air 
superiority over Guadalcanal. Vice Admiral (now Admiral) 
William F. Halsey, Jr., had succeeded to the command of the 
South Pacific [October 18, 1942]. But the Japanese con- 
tinued running in their reinforcements and supplies by night, 
an additional division arriving in small groups after Septem- 
ber. Ten days after the battle off the Cape, the Japanese 
believed again that they had enough strength on Guadalcanal 
to take the airfield. They launched a heavy attack with tanks 
and artillery on the Matanikau River position of the Marines 
[October 21, 1942]. Our lines held. On October 25, another 
large force made a surprise attack from the south against 
the Marine and Army lines in this sector. The next morning 
the rain softened our air strip, grounding our planes; Japa- 
nese bombers hit our positions and their, cruisers shelled the 
area. That night the attack was renewed on both the south 
and west, and for a time threatened serious consequences, 
but the Japanese were turned back in the end with huge 
losses. While this land battle was in progress, planes from 
the carriers Enterprise and Hornet caught Japanese naval 
forces off Santa Cruz Island [October 26, 1942], put two 
Japanese carriers out of action, damaged two battleships and 
four cruisers, and sank two destroyers. We lost the Hornet 
to Japanese planes, but with Henderson Field still in our 
hands the Japanese Navy retreated to the north and did not 
again risk its carriers in the South Pacific. 

Naval Battle of Guadalcanal 

A little more than two weeks later the U. S. Navy scored 
a decisive victory in the battle for Guadalcanal. The engage- 
, ment opened when a cruiser-destroyer force under Rear Ad- 
miral Daniel J. Callaghan intercepted the enemy [November 

in 



13-15, 1942] . His mission was to carry out a delaying action 
which would cover the attack of our battleship-carrier force 
under Rear Admiral (now Vice Admiral) Thomas C. Kinkaid. 
Admiral Callaghan's task force sunk or damaged several Jap- 
anese cruisers and destroyers, and at least one battleship. In 
the first fifteen minutes of gunfire we also suffered severely: 
seven cruisers and destroyers were badly damaged and two 
cruisers and two destroyers were sunk. Later, our battleship- 
carrier force became engaged. Planes from the Enterprise and 
from Henderson Field joined the battle to execute widespread 
destruction, helping to sink an enemy battleship and six 
transports. The battleships Washington and South Dakota 
destroyed another Japanese battleship and lesser vessels. 
These engagements cost us seven destroyers and two cruisers, 
and the lives of Admirals Scott and Callaghan. The Japanese 
lost at least two battleships, four cruisers, six destroyers, and 
a dozen transports. The Navy and land-based air units had 
carried out Admiral Halsey's orders to "hit hard, hit fast, hit 
often." Guadalcanal was saved. 

This American victory, together with cruiser, submarine, 
and destroyer actions which followed, prevented the Japa- 
nese from landing heavy reinforcements on Guadalcanal and 
assured our own troops of sufficient strength to conquer 
the island. 

Meanwhile action continued around Henderson Field. 
From the time of the first Japanese counterattacks in August, 
the Marines and later the Army units were continuously 
fighting a series of defensive battles, patrol actions, and 
limited objective attacks. Malaria, dysentery, and exhaustion 
wore down the men of the 1st Marine Division who got a 
well earned rest early in December when they were replaced 
by the Army's 25th Division. Elements of the 2nd Marine 
Division and the 147th Infantry had also come in, and Major 
General (now Lieutenant General) Alexander M. Patch re- 
placed General Vandegrift in command. With the enlarged 
force, an improved airfield, and the naval victories, we were 
at last able to drive the Japanese army from Guadalcanal. En- 
emy reinforcements had now been cut down to those which 
could be run in by fast destroyers or submarines at night. 

172 



General Patch's forces began vigorous attacks upon the Japa- 
nese now entrenched on the high ground to the southwest and 
in the broken country between the airfield and Cape Esper- 
ance. In about a month, the Americans had cornered, killed, 
and captured all of the remaining Japanese troops [February 
9,1943]. 

Guadalcanal was ours; the threat to our supply line to 
Australia was lifted; and the Japanese drive farthest from 
their homeland had been checked and thrown back. 

The Buna-Sanananda Campaign 

While the fate of Guadalcanal was being decided, another 
long, hard battle was fought by American and Australian 
troops for the possession of southeastern New Guinea. Here 
the Japanese had landed about 11,000 men at Buna, Gona, 
and Sanananda, across the Owen Stanley Mountains toward 
Port Moresby, in a second attempt to strike at Australia. 
They were south of loribaiwa, only thirty miles from Port 
Moresby, when the Australian 6th Division stopped their 
advance. By the end of September the U. S. Fifth Air Force, 
attacking the Japanese route over the mountains, had cut 
the enemy's supply line. The Australians now threatened the 
Japanese front and flank. In an effort to keep his forces intact 
the enemy withdrew to skillfully planned fortifications in the 
coastal swamp at Buna and Sanananda. 

When the remaining Japanese, reinforced by new troops, 
were settling into these coastal defenses, combat teams of 
the U. S. 3 2d Infantry Division arrived in New Guinea to 
support the Australians. The Americans came in mostly by 
air and attacked on the right flank, east and south of Buna, 
while the Australian 7th Division, replacing the 6th, formed 
the left flank and pushed toward Sanananda and Gona. The 
Japanese fought a stubborn defensive battle from a net- 
work of strongly built and well concealed bunkers. 

The Buna front was almost a stalemate, despite hard 
fighting, until the arrival of the Australian 18th Infantry 
Brigade with light tanks. Then two weeks of tank and in- 
fantry assaults broke the Japanese resistance. After the fall 
of Buna [January 2, 1943], a regiment of the American 32d 

173 



Division and the Australian 18th Brigade moved to the San- 
ananada front, where the Japanese were even more firmly 
intrenched. The Australian 7th Division, assisted at first by 
a regiment of the 3 2d Division and later by a regiment of the 
41st Division, had been attacking northward against the 
Japanese positions around Gona and Sanananda. The Aus- 
tralians had taken Gona, a comparatively weak flank posi- 
tion [December 9, 1942], but the Japanese perimeter at 
Sanananda, protected by blocks on the Soputa-Sanananda 
road, was still almost as strong as ever when the units from 
the Buna front arrived. The Australians, aided by the Amer- 
ican regiments, finally smashed all resistance at Sanananda 
[January 23, 1943] . The success of the Allied infantry in the 
Papuan campaign could not have been achieved without the 
cooperation of the U. S. Fifth Air Force, which ferried sup- 
plies and reinforcements to the combat zone. The conquest 
of this southeastern tip of New Guinea started the Allies on 
the long road back to the Philippines and assured the safety 
of Australia. 

III. REINFORCING CHINA, BURMA, AND INDIA 

Japan had temporarily paralyzed Allied naval forces in the 
Pacific and enveloped all of Southeast Asia, threatening both 
India and China by the conquest of Burma. It was now 
essential for the United Nations to hold India and China 
bases where aerial and overland offensives could be prepared 
and launched for the reconquest of Burma and the liberation 
of Asia. Out of the strategic situation of India and China on 
the continental flank of Japan's expanded empire grew the 
CBI (China-Burma-India) Theater of Operations. Defense 
no less than offense depended on supply. In the Far East even 
more than in the South Pacific military strategy and opera- 
tions were limited by this factor. Sea routes between the 
United Nations and CBI stretched over twelve thousand 
miles. The long voyage from home ports, such as Liverpool 
and New York, around Africa to Calcutta consumed both 
time and ships to far greater extent than in any other 
theater.. During all of 1942 and most of 1943, therefore, CBI 
was primarily a theater of supply, its primary mission the 

174 



defense of India and the support of China in the war against 
Japan. 

Burma Road 

Overland transport into China rather than oceanic shipping 
to Burma and India proved to be the bottleneck of CBI sup- 
ply. The Burma Road was China's life line to the outside 
world after Japan had occupied the coast and established a 
naval blockade in 1938. The distance by air from Lashio, the 
railhead in Burma fed by the port of Rangoon, to Kunming 
in Yiinnan Province is 260 miles. Yet the country is so 
mountainous that the Road actually twists over seven hun- 
dred miles of hairpin curves and steep grades; part of it is 
fit only for one-way traffic, and none of it is over sixteen feet 
wide. The Chinese began to build it late in 1937 to circum- 
vent the Japanese blockade. The Road was literally clawed 
out of the mountainsides by an army of workingmen number- 
ing over a hundred thousand. The first traffic in 1939 brought 
supplies into China at the rate of 3,500 tons a month, rising 
to 12,000 tons monthly in 1941 with the introduction of 
American methods of maintenance, though a large proportion 
of the tonnage went for gasoline to fuel the trucks. From the 
middle of 1941 to the fall of Burma, which closed the Road, 
it was protected by the Flying Tigers, officially the American 
Volunteer Group under Brigadier General (now Major Gen- 
eral) Claire L. Chennault. This small group, paid according 
to the number of Japanese planes they destroyed, and skil- 
fully trained and directed in fighting against heavy odds, shot 
down 286 Japanese planes with the loss of only eight pilots. 

The closing of the Burma Road, first by Japanese diplo- 
matic pressure, then by the Japanese conquest of Burma, left 
China stranded for supplies. The only land routes into the 
country from India were pack-animal trails over the Hima- 
laya Mountains, one from Darjeeling northeast to Lhasa in 
Tibet and thence east to Chungking, and another from 
Sadiya to Tali and Kunming. The trip into China over these 
trails took two months, and the country was so rugged that 
only light supplies such as medicines could be carried on the 
backs of porters. In this crisis Lieutenant General (now 
General) Joseph W. Stilwell, appointed the American com- 

175 



mander of CBI early in 1942, resorted to an air ferry over 
the Himalayas. The ferry system was pioneered by the U. S. 
Tenth Air Force under Major General (now Lieutenant Gen- 
eral) Lewis H. Brereton and then transferred to the Air 
Transport Command in order to free the Tenth's bombers for 
raids on enemy targets in Burma. At first air traffic was 
limited because the planes consumed a large part of the 
gasoline they were trying to carry into China. The system 
grew steadily, however, and by the end of 1943 a greater 
tonnage was moving into China every month by air than had 
ever gone overland by the Burma Road. These supplies sup- 
ported the operations in China of the U. S. Fourteenth Air 
Force, established early in 1943 under General Chennault to 
carry on the work of the Flying Tigers in defense of China. 
Late in 1943 American engineers with the help of native 
labor began the building of a new branch road from Ledo in 
northern Assam to the Burma Road. They called it "The 
Road to Tokyo." To clear the way farther eastward, a limited 
campaign was launched in 1944 in northern Burma under the 
command of General Stilwell. 

The Air Forces in CBI 

Until the Burma campaign under General Stilwell, the 
most active military operation in CBI was the strategic 
bombing of Japanese targets in Burma and China by the 
U. S. Tenth and Fourteenth Air Forces. The Tenth flew from 
Indian bases with the threefold mission of defending India, 
protecting the "Hump Line" of the Air Transport Command 
into China, and attacking enemy supply in Burma and Thai- 
land. It bombed 150 targets, including Rangoon, the Moul- 
mein and Akyab docks, Lashio and Henzada storehouses, and 
the rail junctions of Rangoon, Mandalay, and Sagaing, al- 
most denying the enemy use of rail lines in Burma. 

The Fourteenth Air Force had the mission of cooperating 
with Chinese troops in central China against Japanese air 
and shipping lines. One wing was made up of American- 
trained Chinese pilots flying B-25s and P-40s. All supplies 
for the Fourteenth were drawn from the "Hump Line" over 
the Himalaya Mountains. To its fighter planes, long the 
backbone of the Fourteenth and once the entire force of the 

176 



Flying Tigers, were added medium and heavy bombers, which 
raided Hankow, Hong Kong, and the islands of Hainan and 
Formosa. In the first attack on Formosa, where the Japanese 
trans-shipped supplies for Burma and the Pacific, twenty- 
nine planes destroyed forty-two enemy craft and damaged 
twelve more without any American losses. Most important 
was the destruction of 274,939 tons of Japanese shipping 
off the South China coast during 1943. There air attacks 
forced the enemy to rely on barges for his coastal traffic and 
to employ his larger vessels on the open seas where American 
submarines were taking heavy toll. 

IV. THE ALEUTIANS 

Although Japanese task forces were turned back from 
Midway and Dutch Harbor, the northern ships proceeded to 
occupy Attu, Kiska, and Agattu in the foggy Aleutian Islands 
[June 1942] . This seizure of American territory on the Alas- 
kan approaches to the United States alarmed the Pacific 
northwestern states. The occupied territory was strategically 
unimportant, however, except as a base for raiding Alaska 
and limiting American air and sea operations in the North 
Pacific. An immediate effort to recapture these islands was 
impossible so long as ships, planes, and troops were first 
needed for defense of the Central and South Pacific. Ad- 
vanced airfields were set up on Adak and Amchitka [August 
31, 1942] from which bombers constantly attacked Kiska 
and Attu [January 1943]. 

Attu 

When enough troops and ships at last became available, an 
expedition was mounted against Attu, westernmost island in 
the Aleutians, bypassing Kiska. It was hoped that the cap- 
ture of Attu would render Kiska untenable, and it did. U. S. 
forces landed in fog on northeastern Attu at two points, Holtz 
Bay in the north and Massacre Bay about five miles across 
the island to the south [May 11, 1943]. The American force 
consisted of elements of the 7th Infantry Division, reinforced 
by one battalion of the 4th Infantry and Alaska Scouts. 
Major General Eugene M. Landrum commanded the ground 
troops, supported by naval and air units. 

177 



The Japanese had bases at Chichagof Harbor and at Holtz 
Bay where they were completing a small airstrip. The enemy 
defended successive positions which were most of the time 
covered by the fog and snow of the mountains. The machine- 
gun posts and entrenchments dominated every pass. Dual- 
purpose antiaircraft guns and mortars were used effectively 
against the Americans. The Southern Force from Massacre 
Bay made extensive use of artillery, but the almost constant 
fog prevented our bombers from giving much aid to either 
group. Although it was May, the water-filled foxholes, the 
deep mud, the ice-cold surface water, the snow-covered 
mountainsides, and the bitter cold of the nights added ex- 
posure to exhaustion and caused many American casualties. 

The two American forces moved toward each other, driving 
the Japanese into an ever-narrowing pocket about Chichagof 
Harbor. The Northern Force captured Hill X after sharp 
fighting and then occupied the Japanese camp near the end 
of the west arm of Holtz Bay. From here the Japanese posi- 
tions on the ridge separating the two arms of the Bay were 
taken after a day and night of fighting. With the loss of the 
ridge the Japanese fell back toward Chichagof. 

In the meantime, the Southern Force in Massacre Bay had 
been held up by Japanese occupying positions overlooking 
the valley. The advance of the Northern Force threatened to 
cut these Japanese off, and they were withdrawn to the north 
to help defend Massacre-Sarana (Clevesy) Pass, covering the 
southern approach to Chichagof. Against this gateway, 
flanked on both sides by high mountains, the Southern Force 
steadily pushed. The heights on either side were taken by 
frontal attacks and the force moved into Sarana Valley, from 
which another valley led to Chichagof. But the mountains on 
both sides had to be cleared of Japanese before the valley 
approach could be used. When these were taken, the move- 
ment on the valley floor followed. While the Northern Force 
was driving toward Holtz — Chichagof Pass, the Southern 
was attacking a high U-shaped and snow-covered mountain 
range, called the Fish Hook. With the capture of both of 
these objectives after battles at close quarters in which gre- 
nades were the chief weapons, both routes to Chichagof were 
open to the Americans. The Japanese were cornered, and the 

178 



Americans were prepared to move, in for the kill. That night, 
May 28-29, those Japanese who were wounded and unable 
to walk committed suicide or were killed by their own coun- 
trymen. Shortly after midnight the remaining enemy force 
started a desperate attack up the valley which led from 
Chichagof toward the American artilley positions beyond 
Clevesy Pass. The suddenness and momentum of this suicidal 
attack completely disrupted the American units and overran 
our positions in the valley floor. The Japanese were prevented 
from capturing our artillery only by the hastily organized 
resistance of engineer and miscellaneous service units in front 
of the Clevesy Pass. We suffered heavy casualties but the Jap- 
anese were themselves wiped out in confused fighting which 
continued through the day and into the next. The few Jap- 
anese who were not killed by the Americans chose suicide 
rather than surrender. On May 30 only a few snipers re- 
mained to be hunted down, and we occupied Chichagof 
without opposition. 

Kiska 

The American capture of Attu isolated Kiska, 175 miles 
east, where the Japanese had developed their largest base 
in the Aleutians during the year that followed their first 
landing [June 1942]. From Adak and Amchitka our planes 
had raided Japanese installations on Kiska as often as wea- 
ther permitted, and within twelve days of the capture of Attu 
a strip was built there for the operation of additional planes. 
During the first half of 1943 the U. S. Eleventh Air Force 
had dropped three million pounds of bombs on enemy posi- 
tions in the Aleutians. Through June and July Kiska be- 
came the main target until it was ready for ground assault. 

The strongest amphibious force ever mounted in the North 
Pacific made the attack. Units of the Western Defense Com- 
mand, the 7th Infantry Division, and elements of the Royal 
Canadian Army, all under Major General Charles H. Corlett, 
descended on Kiska with a naval escort commanded by Vice 
Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid. Troops landed at Quisling 
Cove on the northwest coast \ August 15, 1943] and were 
followed the next day by forces landing at other points. 

Swift probing of the enemy's camouflaged positions re- 

179 



vealed that he had secretly evacuated all his garrison. Under 
cover of heavy mid-summer fogs the Japanese ships and 
submarines had been able to escape aerial interception, ex- 
cept for a few ships which were sunk or damaged by our 
bombers. The last Japanese may have fled Kiska but a day 
or two before the American landings. As late as July 22 our 
naval forces had encountered heavy fire from enemy shore 
batteries, and pur planes met antiaircraft fire through Au- 
gust 13. No ground reconnaissance had been attempted lest 
its discovery inform the enemy of our intentions. The strong 
American forces landing on Kiska were prepared for a battle 
more difficult than Attn, and the well stocked caves in the 
hills proved that the enemy could have made a bitter last- 
ditch stand. Kiska was the first of their conquests which 
the Japanese abandoned without a fight. 

With the occupation of Kiska the Americans had reclaimed 
all the Aleutians, and these islands became air bases for the 
bombing of the Kuriles on the northern approaches to Tokyo, 
2,174 miles away. From every quarter of the compass Amer- 
ican air power was expanding toward Japan: the Eleventh 
Air Force flew from the Aleutians; the Seventh was based 
in Hawaii; the Thirteenth in the Solomons; the Fifth in 
New Guinea; the Tenth in India; and the Fourteenth in 
China — six great air fleets which ringed the outer defenses 
of the Japanese Empire. 



IZ. VICTORY IN AFRICA 

The liberation of Africa was the first strategic victory won 
from Axis forces by British and American troops. They took 
the offensive in a joint operation, the British driving west 
from Egypt, the Americans and British landing in French 
North Africa and driving east, and both joining forces in 
Tunisia to squeeze the enemy out of Africa. These offensives, 
said Churchill [November 10, 1942], were "part of a single 
strategic and political conception" designed "to open a new 
front against Hitler and Hitlerism, to cleanse the shores of 
Africa from the stain of Nazi and Fascist tyranny, to open 

180 



the Mediterranean to Allied sea power and air power and 
thus effect the liberation of the peoples of Europe." 

I. BATTLE OF EL ALAMEIN 

Through the summer and fall of 1942 Rommel's forces 
stood checked at El Alamein. Their strength was greater on 
paper than in the field. There were twelve undersized divi- 
sions, including the Afrika Korps with the 15th and 21st Pan- 
zer and the 90th and 164th Motorized Divisions, and about 
six hundred tanks in two assemblies. The Axis starved the 
African front of men and materiel to feed the Russian front ; 
but Britain and America diverted the bulk of their supplies 
available in Europe to the Middle East. Montgomery built 
up the British Eighth Army to ten divisions, five from Britain 
and five from the Empire, to full strength. Some fifty thou- 
sand men reached Egypt in American ships to replace those 
lost at Tobruk. British superiority in materiel grew with 
large shipments of tanks, trucks, and guns from America and 
with planes flown directly across the Atlantic. Over one 
thousand planes, more than five hundred medium tanks, and 
twenty thousand trucks had been sent from the United States 
under Lend-Lease in nineteen months. The Eighth Army had 
twice as many planes and tanks as the enemy, and strongest 
among the tanks were the U. S. General Shermans, with 
5mm. guns. It was the quality of this equipment, as well as 
the quantity and the tactics of command, which won the 
Battle of El Alamein and drive the Nazis out of Egypt. 

The Battle 

Since the Axis line for thirty-five miles was a maze of 
strongpoints joined by wire and mines, the first and most 
difficult phase of the battle {October 19-23, 1942] was the 
clearance of forward areas by planes, artillery, infantry, and 
sappers. The RAF gained complete control of the air in a 
week by making seven hundred sorties a day. Axis air forces 
were grounded or destroyed. Then the 25-pounder concen- 
trated the heaviest fire ever heard in the desert on enemy 
batteries and minefields [October 23-24, 1942]. In full moon- 
light four divisions of British infantry penetrated the north- 
ern .sector for five miles under an artillery curtain, and sap- 

181 



pers cleared thousands of mines to open two tank lanes. 
Another attack like the first punched tankheads even deeper 
into enemy lines near the coast [October 31-November 1, 
1942]. 

Rommel flew to the rescue of his forces: he concentrated 
his tanks in the north to stop what appeared to be the main 
British thrust, a move which left him no reserves to meet 
another attack; and then wasted his strength in counter- 
attacks which were foiled by the RAF [October 28-Novem- 
ber 1, 1942]. British tank units, built around Shermans, car- 
ried out the second phase of the battle [November 2-3, 
1942.] They split the Axis armor in the north, cut up the 
rear, and in a great two-day fight of tanks against tanks at El 
Aqqaqir destroyed 260 enemy machines. Rommel's second 
in command, General Stumme, was killed, and the com- 
mander of the Afrika Korps, General Thoma, was captured, 
together with 8,000 German prisoners. Altogether it was 
estimated that the Axis lost 500 tanks, 1,000 guns, and 59,000 
men, killed, wounded, and captured, of which 34,000 were 
Germans, 25,000 Italians. Of the total German and Italian 
casualties, 30,000 were prisoners of war. After two long years 
of war in the African desert, the British Eighth Army had 
won the last decisive battle. 

RommeVs Retreat 

Rommel withdrew the remnants of his army rapidly to El 
Agheila, 860 miles west, destroying supplies, and delaying the 
British pursuit by strewing mines behind him [November 13, 
1942]. From El Agheila he retreated all the way to Tunisia 
without fighting. The British followed, covering thirty miles 
a day along the coastal road, and in rapid succession took the 
old battlegrounds of Mersa Matruh, Sidi Barrani, Tobruk, 
Derna, El Meckili, and Bengasi until they faced Rommel at 
El Agheila [November 8-27, 1942]. But they failed to 
catch Rommel's force because heavy rains and minefields 
slowed down their supply train of 110,000 trucks. 

From December to February, however, the British ad- 
vanced 1,400 miles west from El Alamein. They converted 
Tripoli into a port through which flowed 2,800 tons of sup- 
plies every day. West of Tripoli General Montgomery, with 

182 



only an armored division and brigade, kept at Rommers 
heels. The remainder of Montgomery's troops were busy 
building up supply dumps along the westward routes of 
march. Fighting French troops under General Leclerc made a 
heroic march across the Sahara from Lake Tchad to join the 
British Eighth Army south of Tripoli. But none of these 
forces caught Rommel. His retreat was a military masterpiece 
of speed and economy, for his men withdrew faster than 
planes and tanks could advance. 

II. ANGLO-AMERICAN LANDINGS IN NORTH AFRICA 

The Allied offensive to drive the Axis out of Africa, which 
began with the Battle of El Alamein, was first contemplated 
by President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill when 
they met in Washington in the dark days following Pearl 
Harbor. It was calculated that enough troops and supplies 
could be sent across the Atlantic for a small offensive in 
Africa by late 1942, or a larger offensive against Hitler- 
held Europe by the middle of 1943. The Joint Chiefs of 
Staff decided to strike at the earlier date in North Africa, 
where the Axis was weakest. In Morocco, Algeria, and 
Tunis were French Colonial forces whose help in driving 
the Axis out of Africa we might gain. From African bases 
we might jump to Sicily, freeing Britain's life line to India 
and opening a way for invasion of Italy and Southern France. 
Lieutenant General (now General of the Army) Dwight D. 
Eisenhower, appointed to command the operation, prepared 
his plans for Operation Torch in London during 1942. 

The day the British Eighth Army started to drive west 
from El Alamein [October 24, 1942], a great troop convoy 
put to sea from American ports, and in the next twenty- 
four hours two more convoys left British ports, all bound 
for North Africa. Thus the offensive began from east and 
west, on land in Egypt and at sea five thousand miles across 
the Atlantic Ocean. Three convoys of seven hundred ships 
converged west of Gibraltar and went into French North 
Africa. Within six months this Anglo-American army, join- 
ing the British Eighth Army, would crush half a million 
enemy troops and liberate Africa. 

Three major landings were made on the African coast, two 

183 



on the Mediterranean and one on the Atlantic [November 
8, 1942]. At Algiers the invasion met little opposition; at 
Oran, Vichy French troops capitulated after two days; at 
Casablanca, the Vichy French Navy fought bitterly for five 
days. French resistance ceased [November 12, 1942] when 
Admiral Darlan, the Vichy deputy Chief of State who had 
broken with Petain, reached an agreement with General 
Eisenhower and ordered the French in Africa to cooperate 
with the Allies. By winter fifty thousand French colonial 
troops were ready to fight under General Henri Giraud in 
support of Allied forces. Meanwhile other landings were 
made at Agadir, Mogador, Port Lyautey, and close to Tunisia 
at Philippeville and Bone. 

These landings caught the Axis by surprise, but Nazi 
troops soon poured southward to hold the Mediterranean 
coasts of Europe and Africa. They swept into unoccupied 
France [November 27, 1942] and found three-quarters of 
the French Navy scuttled when they reached Toulon [No- 
vember 11, 1942]. They took the island of Corsica, hitherto 
occupied by the Italians, seized the Tunisian ports of Bi- 
zerte and Tunis, and rushed troops into Tunisia by plane at 
the rate of a thousand a day. The Luftwaffe covered these 
reinforcements from interior bases in Sicily and Sardinia, 
but the British Navy sank about one-third of all enemy 
naval convoys. 

The Allies had not been able to seize Tunisia by landing 
there, first because they lacked enough ships and aircraft 
carriers to penetrate the central Mediterranean, and second 
because they had to keep large forces in the rear for supply 
and for protection against a possible enemy thrust through 
Spain and Spanish Morocco. Yet General Eisenhower or- 
dered advance guards overland into Tunisia in an effort to 
keep the enemy from occupying it [November 11, 1942]. 
There was hardly more than a division in Algiers, and troops 
pushing eastward moved over bad roads, without good com- 
munications or airfields, leaving their main bases five hun- 
dred miles behind them [November 15, 1942]. The enemy 
was waiting for them at Mateur, having seized the moun- 
tain approaches to Tunisia [December 1-28, 1942]. He 
proved too strong to be brushed aside, and the Tunisian front 

184 



was stabilized for the cold, rpiny winter on a line running 
north and south of Medjez-el-Bab. Both sides raced to build 
up strength for the inevitable Battle of Tunisia. Tt was not 
to be won, as the Allies had hoped, by beating the enemy 
to the draw. 

III. CASABLANCA CONFERENCE: UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER 

The American troops who had landed in North Africa were 
surprised to be reviewed by their Commander in Chief, 
President Roosevelt, at Casablanca. He had come to foreign 
soil for the first time since the deployment of American 
forces all over the world, to confer with the British Prime 
Minister on the prosecution of the war and the requirements 
for victory [January 14-26, 1943]. Churchill and Roosevelt 
had met before in Washington and on the Atlantic, but this 
was the first prolonged conference of the two Allied leaders 
with their Combined Chiefs of Staff. Premier Stalin of the 
USSR and Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek of China, both 
unable to attend, were kept informed of the discussions. 
General Charles de Gaulle, commanding the Fighting French, 
and General Henri Giraud, High Commissioner of French 
Africa, were brought together at Casablanca to unite their 
countrymen in opposition to Hitler. 

In these discussions and negotiations the United Nations 
began to pass from the paper declaration which they had 
signed a year before in Washington to an actual union whose 
strength would be put forth on the battlefields of the world. 
The tide was turning in the war against the Axis from de- 
fense to offense, defeat to victory, by the time of the Casa- 
blanca Conference. The strategic initiative had been snatched 
from the enemy at Guadalcanal, in New Guinea, at El Ala- 
mein, Stalingrad, and in Tunisia. 

Victories at these enemy outposts pointed to future pene- 
tration of the main lines of enemy resistance in Europe and 
Asia. The leaders meeting at Casablanca planned operations 
with the principal aim according to the communique, of draw- 
ing "as much weight as possible off the Russian armies by 
engaging the enemy as heavily as possible at the best selected 
points." The conference was not only occupied with strategy 
against Germany. "The entire field of the war was surveyed 

185 



theater by theater throughout the world, and all resources 
were marshalled for a more intense prosecution of the war 
by sea, land and air." 

The most immediate task was to finish the Tunisian cam- 
paign and destroy the enemy in Africa. The next offensive 
move was to be the invasion and conquest of Sicily, where 
we could extend our control over the Mediterranean and 
knock Italy out of the war. Steps were also taken to assist 
China and widen the range of offensive action in the Pacific. 
The Combined Chiefs of Staff drew up a schedule for simul- 
taneous blows against the Japanese during the summer of 
1943 in the Southwest and South Pacific, and approved plans 
to eliminate the Japanese from the Aleutians in the North 
Pacific. 

The ultimate object of this strategy, stated President 
Roosevelt, was the "unconditional surrender" of the Axis 
Powers. He borrowed the phrase from General Ulysses S. 
Grant, who had used it in a letter to the Confederate com- 
mander of Forts Henry and Donelson demanding their ca- 
pitulation in the American Civil War. In the last war Presi- 
dent Wilson had called for "force to the utmost" and de- 
clared that there could be no peace without absolute victory. 
Now President Roosevelt asserted that there would be no 
appeasement, no negotiation, no end to the war short of 
complete victory, unconditional surrender of the enemy. 
The Casablanca Conference was the first meeting of the 
United Nations which set these terms for peace. 

IV. BATTLE OF TUNISIA 

The Tunisian campaign was the first in which American 
troops joined the British to defeat the Nazis. It fell into 
four phases. First came the landings in Africa and the vain 
rush to beat the enemy to Tunisia [November 8-December 
28, 1942]. Then followed the winter scramble by both sides 
to recruit their forces and capture the best tactical jump- 
off positions for battle in the spring [January 1-February 
10, 1943] . The third phase was marked by a strong German 
raid which threatened the American base at Tebessa but was 
concluded by the plunge of the British Eighth Army around 
the Mareth Line [February 11-April 13, 1943]. Finally 

186 



came the offensive in which the Allied Eighteenth Army 
Group worked like a machine to compress the enemy in 
the Tunisian cylinder until he was at last destroyed [April 
14-May 13, 1943]. 

Rommel's Raid 

Through the winter the Nazis stabbed at the Allied lines 
in the west, first with a force of one armored and four in- 
fantry divisions under General Arnim and then with panzer 
divisions from the Afrika Korps. These troops launched five 
attacks which kept the Tunisian corridor open for Rom- 
mel's retreat but failed to break the Allied lines. 

The strongest Nazi offensive, indeed their last in Africa, 
was a raid by the veteran 21st Panzer Division against 
green American units dispersed at the end of long supply 
lines in front of Gafsa. German armor swept through the 
Fai'd Pass to Sbeitla, Gafsa, and Feriana in a three-pronged 
thrust which overran the Kasserine Pass [February 14, 
1943]. Almost half the tanks of the 1st Armored Division 
were lost in fierce fighting, and the Americans fell back to 
escape encirclement from the south. The Allied position in 
central Tunisia was in danger. To check the enemy break- 
through, the 9th and 34th Infantry Divisions sped to the 
front from Oran, and artillery of the 9th rushed forward 
on a forced march of 770 miles in three days. British units 
contained the enemy's northern flank, and all the Allied 
bombers took the sky [February 22, 1943]. This concentra- 
tion of force stopped Rommel short of Thala and drove 
him back through the K^.sserine Pass [February 25, 1943]. 
He withdrew under the protection of artillery and minefields. 
American troops recaptured Sbeitla [March 1, 1943], Gafsa 
and El Guettar [March 17, 1943], and advanced to Mak- 
nassy to threaten the rear of the Mareth Line [March 22, 
1943]. ''The troops that come out of this campaign," ob- 
served General Eisenhower, "are going to be battle-wise and 
tactically efficient." 

Allied Reorganization 

For the great offensive in Tunisia the Allied forces were 
combined in the 18th Army Group [February 4, 1943] un- 

187 



der General (now Field Marshal) Sir Harold R. Alexander, 
with General Eisenhower in supreme command of all forces — 
military, naval, and air. The 18th Army Group embraced the 
British First Army under General Anderson, the Eighth un- 
der General Montgomery, the French XIX Corps, under 
General Alphonse Juin, and the U.. S. II Corps of four divi- 
sions, first commanded by Major General (now Lieutenant 
General) Lloyd R. Fredendall, then by Lieutenant General 
(now General) George S. Patton, Jr., and later by Lieutenant 
General (now General) Omar N. Bradley. Air Chief Marshal 
Sir Arthur Tedder took charge of all air forces, to give ground 
troops the close tactical support he had developed in Libya, 
and Admiral (now Admiral of the Fleet) Sir Andrew Cunning- 
ham commanded the Mediterranean Fleet. Thus there was 
unity of Allied command from start to finish of the Tunisian 
offensive. 

Altogether a total of 500,000 troops had been landed in 
North Africa, but many of these men were operating rail- 
roads, guarding the rear, and providing supply. Opposed to 
the Allies were General Arnim, with an estimated 92,000 
troops in the north, and Marshal Rommel with about 75,000 
of his Afrika Korps in the Mareth Line to the south. The 
enemy intended to fight a delaying action while he improved 
the defenses of southern Europe, and if it were possible, of 
course, he wanted to hold his African bridgehead. The Allied 
forces planned to destroy the enemy in Africa by reducing 
his Tunisian perimeter, first by punching it in from the south 
and then by squeezing it from the west. 

Battle of the Mareth Line 

The British Eighth Army had caught up with Rommel's 
forces after they retired into the fortified hills of the old 
French Mareth Line [February 18, 1943]. A panzer jab at 
Montgomery's right cost Rommel fifty tanks [March 6, 
1943], and he was recalled to Germany, ostensibly on sick 
leave [March 15, 1943]. With the Americans at Maknassy 
and the French south of them around Ksar Rhilane, to hang 
on Axis communications and divide their reserves, Mont- 
gomery broke the Mareth Line. After heavy artillery prepa- 
ration [March 21-22, 1943], the 50th Division bridged an 

188 



antitank ditch under murderous machine-gun fire and got 
tanks across the water-logged Wadi Zigzaou, but recoiled 
from the counterattacks of two panzer divisions. Pinning the 
enemy in front, Montgomery turned the Mareth Line by a 
left hook delivered with all his reserves. On this flank Frey- 
berg's New Zealand Division penetrated minefields and 
breached the Roman Wall, and the 4th Indian Division 
circled the enemy's rear through the Matmata Hills. Ameri- 
can armor closed in from Maknassy. To escape this trap, the 
Germans switched troops from front to flank [March 26, 
1943], and the British 51st Division plunged through the 
weakened Mareth Line [March 27, 1943]. As the Nazis 
abandoned the Mareth sector, they maintained their western 
flank with minefields, and British armor pressed them along 
the coast to Gabes [March 29, 1943] . In ten days the Eighth 
Army took eight thousand prisoners. 

To cut off the enemy's retreat, the U. S. 1st Armored 
Division pushed east from El Guettar, ran into defiladed tank 
fire, and closed on the enemy flank after engineers cleared 
mines to provide wider approaches [April 2, 1943]. In a sur- 
prise night attack [April 6, 1943] the 4th Indian Division 
broke the new enemy line at Wadi-el-Akharit with another 
left hook, and the Afrika Korps withdrew still farther north 
toward Enfidaville, losing 9,500 prisoners [April 12, 1943]. 
As the British moved north to occupy Sfax and Sousse, 
patrols met advance guards of U. S. II Corps on the Gabes 
road and linked up the Allied lines [April 8, 1943]. Hence- 
forth the British Eighth Army could be supplied from North 
African ports, and troops could be shuttled back and forth 
along the entire Tunisian front. The U. S. 34th Infantry 
Division and British 6th Armored Division combined to 
capture Fondouk Pass [April 12, 1943], leading to the Ger- 
man flank, but occupied Kairouan too late to catch the 
enemy by a breakthrough to the sea. The Afrika Korps fell 
back on Arnim's reinforcements and established a perimeter 
defense of northern Tunisia along a front of 122 miles. 

To Bizerte and Tunis 

For the final reduction of the Axis perimeter General 
Alexander shifted his attack from the narrow bottleneck at 

189 



the south to the broad western side, where British, American, 
and French troops could maneuver in unison. Three divisions 
of the Eighth Army were transferred to the First Army with 
such secrecy that the enemy still kept his reserves in the 
south to check the Eighth. U. S. II Corps of 100,000 men 
under General Bradley moved 150 miles north, passing 
through the British First Army and crossing a dense traffic 
in supplies, to the Beja road which ran to Bizerte [April 16, 
1943]. After this reorganization the British Eighth Army 
opened the final offensive with a show of force which suc- 
ceeded and enabled them to pin the enemy in the south 
and take Enfidaville [April 20, 1943]. 

The British First Army launched the main drive toward 
Tunis [April 21, 1943] on two flanks from Medjez-el-Bab, 
and made slow progress against enemy tanks until stopped 
before Djebel-bou-Aoukaz, a hill 2,200 feet high which domi- 
nated the route of advance. Three savage attacks under air 
and artillery cover finally won the crest, but the position was 
isolated by enemy counterattacks [April 27-30, 1943]. 
The French XIX Corps had the greatest success in the south, 
taking the highest mountain, Djebel-el-Zaghouan, and punch- 
ing in the flanks at Pont-du-Fahs. 

The Allies moved eastward on Bizerte and Tunis with 
constant air support through the parallel valleys of Melah, 
Djoumine, and Medjerda. But the going was tough and slow 
because the enemy held the hills. U. S. II Corps, made up 
of the 1st Armored and the 1st, 9th, and 34th Infantry Divi- 
sions, joined the attack with an advance of five miles from 
Djebel Abiod [April 23-25, 1943]. The corps advanced in 
two groups, a northern wing astride the road from Sedjenane 
and a southern wing along the Beja road, both converging 
on Mateur. Hill after hill was stormed or flanked in bitter 
fighting. Key positions often changed hands several times 
before the German defenders were forced to fall back. The 
heaviest fighting on the corps front took place around Jefna 
(Jaffna) and Sidi Nsir on the road to Mateur and in the hills 
south and east of the Tine (Mousetrap) [April 26-27, 1943] . 

The crux of the American attack was at Djebel Tahent, 
Hill 609 [April 28-29, 1943], the enemy's main position cov- 
ering Mateur. The storming of two supporting heights prom- 

190 



ised to envelop it, but terrific mortar fire swept the Americans 
from a line half-way up the rocky sides of 609. An attack 
launched the next day \May 1, 1943] captured this hill fort- 
ress, and our troops took full possession after one day's fight- 
ing. Meanwhile, the 9th Division had outflanked Jefna on the 
north, and the Germans had to abandon the hills that made 
up the Jefna position [May 3, 1943]. The Americans cap- 
tured Mateur and came within thirteen miles of Bizerte, 
north of Lake Achkel, as the enemy began to move south on 
Tunis where he could find refuge at Cape Bon. This with- 
drawal made it easier for U. S. II Corps to move up the 
Ferryville road and to send units south to cooperate with the 
British in squeezing the 15th Panzer Division out of Te- 
bourba [May 4-8, 1943]. 

The British First Army renewed its drive on Tunis [May 
5, 1943] along a front of ten miles, with tanks in the center, 
and infantry on the flanks, covered by 1,200 sorties of the 
Twelfth Air Force. Massicault was taken [May 6, 1943], 
and tanks broke through enemy lines to surprise German 
soldiers sitting in the cafes of Tunis. With the occupation of 
this port [May 7, 1943] the Axis forces in Tunisia were 
cut in two. 

The same day the U. S. II Corps occupied Ferryville, a 
motorized battalion reached Bizerte [May 7 , 1943], and next 
day U. S. armored units cleared the streets of snipers, crossed 
the ship channel and captured enemy rear guards. The 
Americans, together with the French Moroccan Corps under 
General Giraud, had trapped about 25,000 Nazi troops in 
northern Tunisia. The enemy was now confused and disor- 
ganized. His perimeter defense had been flattened in the 
north at Bizerte, cut in the center at Tunis, and pressed in 
from the south by the advancing French and British. British 
motor patrols from Tunis raced along the base of the Cape 
Bon peninsula [May 11, 1943] and joined the Eighth Army 
to prevent the enemy from carrying out Hitler's order to 
"fight to the last cartridge." With no place left to make 
a last stand, the Nazis surrendered. 

In the Battle of Tunisia fifteen enemy divisions were de- 
stroyed. Prisoners, including fourteen German and four Ital- 
ian generals, numbered 267,000. When General Arnim was 

191 



captured \May 12, 1943], Italian units in the south — last 
to hold out — surrendered. Enemy losses in materiel ran to 
250 tanks, over 2,330 aircraft, and 232 ships. Allied casual- 
ties in the Tunisian campaign were less than 70,000. The 
Americans lost 2,184 killed, 9,437 wounded, and 6,937 miss- 
ing, a total of 18,558. For the four American divisions of II 
Corps who fought there, Tunisia was a school of battle; they 
landed in Africa green and entered Bizerte seven months 
later veterans. 

The air forces under Marshal Tedder, which had answered 
every call of ground troops in Tunisia for reconnaissace and 
bombardment, now launched a furious aerial assault upon 
the Italian islands off the Tunisian coast [May 30-June 8, 
1943]. A severe naval and air bombardment demoralized 
the Italian garrison of 11,150 on Pantelleria [June 11, 1943], 
and they surrendered without resistance. Lampedusa also fell 
after one day of continuous bombardment [June 12, 1943]. 
Linosa and Lampione, small adjacent islands were taken over 
with little difficulty [June 13, 1943]. The capture of these 
islands completed the conquest of North Africa and gave 
Allied sea power more effective control of the Mediterranean. 
The Middle East was at last safe and Africa had been 
liberated from the Axis. 



24. THE RED ARMY ON THE OFFENSIVE 



I. BATTLE OF STALINGRAD 

The high-water mark of the German invasion of Russia, 
outside the Caucasus, was Stalingrad. The siege and relief 
of this city proved to be a turning point of the war. Here 
the Nazis lost the momentum of their advance, never to 
regain it. Here the Red Army first changed from strategic 
defense to offense all along the front south of Leningrad. 
The Red Army had thus far demonstrated its mastery of 
defense in depth; now it was to gain superiority on the 
offensive. 

Stalingrad was the Russian Detroit. It lies forty miles 
east of the Don Bend and straggles twenty miles along 

192 



the western bank of the Volga River. The Nazis had ap- 
proached this city of tank and tractor factories in a pincers 
movement from northwest and southwest and penetrated 
its outskirts in a three-pronged assault. If Stalingrad fell 
to the invaders, they would be able to circle north on 
Moscow or swing south to the Caspian Sea and cut off 
the oil of the Caucasus. Even if they went no farther than 
Stalingrad, they could choke communications on the Volga 
and seize its rich freight. 

"The occupation of Stalingrad," boasted Hitler, "will be- 
come a gigantic success ... no human being will push us 
away from that spot." The conqueror "cuts off thirty million 
tons of traffic, including nine million tons of oil. There flows 
the entire wheat gathered from the Ukraine and Kuban, and 
manganese ore. I wanted to take it." [N ovember 8, 1942] 
This was the strategy of the hungry Nazi. 

The Nazi Siege 

For sixty-six days [September 14-N ovember 19, 1942] 
the German Sixth Army of twenty-two divisions under Gen- 
eral von Paulus smashed at Stalingrad with everything it had 
. — Stukas, howitzers, tanks, mortars, and men. Not since Ma- 
drid in the Spanish Civil War had a great city become a bat- 
tlefield. Nazi infantry actually conquered most of Stalingrad 
in the course of two months' relentless fighting, and occupied 
four miles along the western bank of the Volga around the 
Barricade Factory. But they never swept the Russians en- 
tirely out of the city or across the Volga River. 

The Sixty-second Army of sixteen divisions under Gen- 
eral Chuikov, ordered to hold Stalingrad while the great 
counteroffensive was prepared, fought for every street and 
factory, defended the strongpoints made by the walls, rubble, 
and craters of shattered buildings, and died by the thousands 
in the ravines leading down to the Volga. There they caught 
the enemy with enfilading fire from batteries mounted across 
the river. When Stukas destroyed the bridges by which the 
garrison was supplied, a bridge one mile long was laid under 
water and used at night unseen by the Luftwaffe. The de- 
fenders of Stalingrad were finally driven back into the high 
bluff along the Volga. There in a maze of dugouts, under- 

193 



ground forts, and firing posts, only one hundred to one 
thousand yards from the river, they held fast. Each mile 
of the sixteen-mile barrier was covered by a division, and 
among these units were six of the finest in the Red Army 
The 70th Division of ten thousand men under General Ivan 
Ludnikov had eight hundred survivors. The heaviest bom- 
bardment of the war reduced Stalingrad to a mass of girders, 
broken walls, and iron bedsteads, but its garrison survived. 
Despite its capture, the city never gave up. 

When the Red Army came to drive the Nazis out, it found 
them as difficult to exterminate as rats. There was little fight- 
ing in the open streets, and no barricades were built, but the 
ruins of every building had to be stormed. At night the 
Russians secretly dug foxholes and trenches to approach a 
strongpoint. Then, without any artillery preparations, small 
shock squads of six to eight men, each armed with ten 
grenades, a tommy gun and a dagger, surprised the enemy 
post. These assault detachments were supported by rein- 
forcements heavily armed with machine guns, mortars, pick- 
axes, and explosives, and by reserves who broke up counter- 
attacks. The defenders scaled the upper stories of buildings 
to reach firing points against the enemy outside, set up 
gun posts on the corners to ward off counterattacks, forced 
the Germans indoors, and drove them down to the cellars 
to be killed. "Throw a grenade and follow in" — those were 
the tactics. In this way they stormed in twenty-six hours the 
six-storied "L-Shaped House," which sprawled over two city 
blocks and gave the Germans domination of the Volga. The 
surprise, speed, and daring of Indian raids, added to system- 
atic planning, characterized the Russian tactics to clear the 
ruins of their great city. 

Russian Counteroffensive in the Donbas 

But the main blows to liberate Stalingrad were struck from 
far outside the city. They took the form of an offensive, 
mounted in two months by Marshal Zhukov, to trap the 
Nazis in Stalingrad and drive other enemy armies back to the 
Donets. The first mission of some half million troops was to 
isolate the enemy at Stalingrad by cutting his two railroads 
from Rostov and Kharkov. A double envelopment was 

194 



planned in the German style, although the Russians called 
it a hammer and sickle, to trap the Nazi Sixth Army in an 
area of fifty square miles. The first blow was struck from 
the north through Serafimovich by three tank and two cavalry 
corps, and next came a thrust from the south by two tank 
and one cavalry corps. These forces possessed overwhelming 
fire power. For the first time since the Battle of Moscow all 
the weapons that the Russians could muster, including three 
thousand planes and four thousand tanks which had come by 
Lend-Lease from America and Britain, were hurled into 
battle. 

In the north they destroyed three divisions of Italian and 
Hungarian infantry in a swift advance southwest across the 
Don [November 19-24, 1942] to cut the Rostov railroad at 
Oblivskaya. General Rodin's I Tank Corps raced sixty-two 
miles to take the Don bridgehead of Kalach forty miles west 
of Stalingrad. Tolbukhin penetrated the northernmost de- 
fenses of the enemy corridor stretching from the Don to the 
Volga. The Nazi left flank was enveloped. From the southeast 
Rokossovsky and Malinovsky struck at the Novorossisk rail- 
road, shutting the last door by which the enemy could retreat 
[November 20-27, 1942]. 

The German Sixth Army was trapped by the closing of the 
pincers west of Kalach when Red tanks met at Marinovka 
[November 23, 1942]. Until it was too late to break out of 
this trap, the enemy did not guess the strength of the en- 
circling Russians. The Nazi garrison consisted of twenty-two 
divisions, ten German, six Italian, and the remainder from 
the Balkans, a total of between 300,000 and 400,000 men. 
General von Paulus organized these troops in a hedgehog de- 
fense, and reduced his perimeter under pressure until its 
boundaries north and south were only twenty miles apart 
[December 12, 1942]. Because the railroads had been cut, 
the garrison was supplied daily by air fleets of four hundred 
to five hundred Ju-52 transports, which the Russians shot 
down by the score. 

To the relief of the Sixth Army came a force of 120,000 
troops under General Manstein [December 12-24, 1942], 
organized in two tank, two cavalry, and four infantry divi- 
sions. They swept up the Kalmuk steppes from Kotelnikov- 

195 



ski, 110 miles southwest, and ran into a Red Army under 
General Malinovsky which recaptured the city [December 
29, 1942] and hurled them back two hundred miles toward 
Rostov. Caught in the Stalingrad sack, von Paulus counter- 
attacked on all sides [December 12-31, 1942] with losses 
mounting up to 100,000. His fate was sealed by the defeat 
of Manstein's relief forces. 

Paulus refused the Russian demand for surrender because 
Hitler had ordered him to resist to the last man [January 
8-9, 1943]. So Rokossovsky annihilated his army. The ring 
of iron and fire around Stalingrad was drawn ever tighter, 
with the main attack from the west, enfilade fire from north 
and south, and savage fighting by Chuikov's army inside the 
city [January 10-February 2, 1943]. The Nazi field forces 
were driven back on Stalingrad as the Russians had been in 
August. After twelve days the Germans lost their last means 
of supply, the airfields, and relief planes disappeared from 
the sky. Then Soviet troops from the west smashed to the 
Volga and split the enemy forces in half. 

The end came when General Paulus, recently promoted by 
Hitler to Field Marshal, was captured in what had been the 
business district of southern Stalingrad. The Axis lost 330,000 
men. They were beaten, one of the captured generals said, 
"by hunger, cold, and lack of ammunition." The Red Army 
which beat them claimed the capture of more than 200,000 
troops, 60,000 trucks, 6,700 guns, and 1,500 tanks in the 
greatest defeat ever administered to a German field army. 
It was the turn of the tide in the Russian war: henceforth 
the Nazis were pushed steadily west until they were driven 
from the Soviet Union. 

II. THE WINTER CAMPAIGN, 1942-43 

Clearing the Donbas 

When the Russians first encircled Stalingrad, they also 
mounted two other offensives south and north of the city to 
clear the Don basin. It was probably to cover the withdrawal 
of his troops from the Caucasus and the Don menaced by 
these offensives, that Hitler ordered the Sixth Army to stand 
at Stalingrad. Maslenikov pressed the Germans as they re- 



tired from the northern Caucasus toward Rostov [December 
13, 1942- January 17, 1943] and with the cooperation of 
Malinovsky's army forced them to evacuate Rostov and fall 
back toward Taganrog [February 15, 1943]. Although the 
Nazis had to abandon the Caucasus entirely, they retired in 
good order and with few losses. At the Black Sea base of 
Novorossisk they managed to retain a brido;ehead to protect 
their southern flank in the Crimea and to close the Sea of 
Azov. 

Meanwhile, northwest of Stalingrad on the middle Don, 
two armies under Vatutin and Golikov drove southwest to cut 
the railroads below Voronezh [December 20, 1942]. Loss of 
these lines would trap the enemy in the Don Bend. Under 
heavy artillery iire and tank attacks, Manstein withdrew 
rapidly from the Don to the Donets [January 18, 1943] . The 
Russians claimed 56,000 prisoners in this advance of 150 
miles. 

Farther north on the Don, a pincers movement of Vasilev- 
sky [January 16-28, 1943], encircled the lagging Axis in- 
fantry at Voronezh and captured 27,000 prisoners. The aim 
of this drive was to catch the enemy in the upper Don and 
free the main railroad from Rostov to Moscow. The Russian 
advance in February gathered such momentum that the Ger- 
mans could not even defend a second railroad through Bel- 
gorod and Kursk, as they had planned, but were compelled 
to abandon Kursk, Belgorod, and Kharkov. In this campaign 
along the Voronezh front, Moscow estimated that the enemy 
lost almost as many men as at Stalingrad. The Red Army 
reclaimed both the Don and Donets Rivers, with two main 
railroads to Moscow, and recovered all the territory which 
the Nazis had taken in 1942. 

Capture of the Rzhev Salient 

Another offensive north of Moscow, planned by Zhukov to 
divert enemy strength from Stalingrad, wiped out the danger- 
ous Rzhev salient that had threatened the capital since 1941. 
Hitler had said that the Germans would feel the loss of 
Rzhev as much as the destruction of half of Berlin. Rzhev 
was one of the most strongly defended salients in the main 
line of German defenses. It contained hedgehogs bristling 

197 



with tank traps, minefields, and gun emplacements, arranged 
for mutual support and stocked to hold out, even if surround- 
ed, until reinforcements came. Gaps between hedgehogs were 
held by infantry, a division to every nine miles, and armored 
divisions formed a mobile reserve. 

In the initial assault on Rzhev [November 25, 1942], 
tanks surprised the enemy by crossing the Volga over a 
bridge, like that at Stalingrad, secretly laid eighteen inches 
under water. While attacks proceeded on the whole front, 
the main effort was directed toward Velikie Luki, rear supply 
base on a railroad feeding Rzhev. The Germans were sur- 
rounded [January 1, 1943], but broke out in desperate coun- 
terattacks [January 15-16, 1943] ; and as they withdrew 
west they left the area more devastated than any earth 
scorched by Russians. After nearly a year and a half of per- 
sistent attacks the Red Army had finally recaptured a salient 
of 160 miles covering Rzhev, Velikie Luki, and Vyazma 
[March 12, 1943]. It was a strategic victory as great as 
Stalingrad because it opened the road to Smolensk. 

Second Winter Counter offensive 

The Russians also opened a corridor to Leningrad, which 
had been under siege since 1941 and was supplied only across 
Lake Ladoga. Artillery preparation on a ten-mile front, cov- 
ered by two hundred guns every mile, demoralized the enemy. 
The Leningrad garrison attacked eastward to join Voroshi- 
lov's troops advancing west [January 18, 1943]. Although 
German artillery still controlled the corridor, the relief of 
Leningrad was begun. 

In the south the Russians pressed forward to liberate the 
mines, factories, and wheatfields of the Ukraine, but were 
driven back by a limited German counteroffensive. "General 
Winter" deserted the Russians. An early thaw bogged down 
supply wagons at a time when troops were still widely dis- 
persed as a result of the rapid winter advance. The Germans 
finished the general withdrawal begun in December and rein- 
forced their troops with several armored divisions [February 
17, 1943]. When Vatutin attempted to encircle Stalino from 
the northeast, Manstein simultaneously started a pincers 
movement with superior forces to annihilate Vatutin's army 

198 



[March 2, 1943]. The Russians withdrew safely across the 
Donets, losing only their rear guards, but since the Nazis 
outnumbered the Russians three to one, they circled north to 
recapture Kharkov. Bad weather stopped all fighting and 
lines were stabilized, as each side prepared for summer 
offensives. 

Since taking the initiative at Stalingrad, the Russians had 
advanced 435 miles west on several fronts, and recovered 
185,000 square miles of territory. In this winter campaign 
Moscow claimed the death of 850,000 and the capture of 
343,000 Axis soldiers. The Red Army made its gains partly 
because it was willing to accept heavy losses and had the 
reserves to survive them. Russian success was also due to new 
tactics. To penetrate the Nazi system of defense in depth, 
they combined all arms, with air officers at infantry head- 
quarters to direct Stormovik planes in close tactical sup- 
port of ground troops; they massed heavy artillery to fire at 
short range over open sights; and they consolidated tank 
brigades into armored corps which swept the flanks of hedge- 
hog defenses. New weapons were important too. There was 
"Katusha," the rocket gun, and the low-flying armored 
Stormovik, the plane which the Germans called "Black 
Death." Essentially it was the union of fire and movement 
and men that overcame the enemy. 

Although the Germans retreated to prepared lines in good 
order, their first-line fighting strength in Russia was per- 
manently depleted. They had 211 divisions along the Eastern 
Front in 1942, besides their satellite forces, but after the 
winter campaign 188 divisions were left. These losses would 
be repaired and a new Sixth Army would take the field; but 
none of the new divisions would ever prove equal to the old. 
No longer were there veteran strategic reserves to sustain a 
new offensive or to avert further retreat. Attrition foreshad- 
owed the defeat of the Nazis in Russia. 

III. THE CONTINUOUS OFFENSIVE, 1943 

By the summer of 1943 the Axis strength in Russia reached 
218 divisions of 4,500,000 men. Stalin announced that al- 
most as many Russians — 4,200,000 — had been killed in 
two years of war. But the Soviet Union had recruited and 

199 



trained an army still larger than any the enemy could put 
in the field. Both Germany and the USSR opened limited 
offensives on the upper Don front north of Kharkov which 
quickly proved decisive. Here their lines took the form of a 
letter "S" upside down, the Nazis holding the upper loop 
east of Orel and the Russians the lower bend west of Kursk. 
Each aimed at wiping out the other's salient in order to 
shorten lines and secure the main railroad running north 
through Russian Kursk and German Orel. As their lines were 
interlocked, so were their offensives. 

Kursk-Orel Battles 

Russian reconnaissance spotted every enemy move to cut 
off the Kursk wedge. Since the Nazis could spare only thirty- 
nine divisions for pressing in the Russian flanks from Orel 
and Belgorod, they attacked on narrow two-mile fronts with 
concentrated armor [July 5, 1943]. For spearheads they 
used two or three hundred Tigers, a 60-ton Mark VI tank; 
and to cripple Soviet armor, they massed Ferdinands, self- 
propelled 70-ton tank destroyers firing an 88mm. gun. 
Through gaps in the southern neck of the Russian salient. 
Tigers raced twenty miles into the enemy rear. A gigantic 
tank battle developed [July 7, 1943] ; losses were estimated 
at over one thousand machines for each side. The Russians 
knocked out Tigers and Ferdinands alike at five hundred 
yards with massed artillery fire and mobile antitank, re- 
serves. With superior air power and almost equal numbers 
of troops, the Red Army doggedly maintained the flanks of 
its salient, absorbed the enemy tank punches without giving 
much ground, and crippled the Nazi armor. 

Once the Nazis had committed their reserves above Bel- 
gorod, three Soviet armies in the north attacked fifty Ger- 
man divisions with concentric blows on the Orel salient [July 
12, 1943]. Konev pushed south rapidly, but the main attack 
was directly on the enemy front. Rokossovsky hammered it 
with the greatest artillery preparation of any war. He fired 
2,950 guns on every mile of his 19-mile front, a barrage ten 
times heavier than at Verdun. A path was blasted open for 
tanks to advance slowly but steadily about two miles a day, 
until they outflanked Orel from the south, captured the city, 

200 



and ironed out the Nazi salient of one hundred miles [August 
5, 1943]. Each day of the advance both tanks and planes 
were heavily engaged. This was the severest fighting that 
the Germans had ever encountered. It was a battle of attri- 
tion which the Russians were prepared to repeat on every 
front until they exhausted or annihilated the Nazi armies. 
The Red Army had snatched the offensive from the Nazis 
within a week of the attack on Kursk. Their first summer 
offensive at Orel was the beginning of a continuous offensive 
which would be interrupted only for reorganization and 
supply. 

Nazi Retreat to the Dnieper 

The German command decided to withdraw to positions 
west of the Desna and south along the Dnieper River. The 
strategic position in Russia alone was enough to make re- 
treat the order of the day. Moreover, the fall of Mussolini, 
the approach of British and American armies through Sicily, 
and the raids of Tito's guerrillas in Yugoslavia created an 
imperative need for reserves to strengthen the Italian and 
Balkan walls of Fortress Europe. For three years the Ger- 
mans had mounted their Russian offensives with diminishing 
strength, but this was the first to fail. Now they must shift 
to defense and rely on new levies of troops, inadequately 
trained to withstand the fierce Russian fighting. 

The Red Army did not wait for the Germans to retreat. 
At no time were German armies allowed to disengage them- 
selves, to withdraw without losses, or to take up strategic 
positions more favorable for defense. The strength of their 
forces deteriorated as they shortened their lines. The Rus- 
sians unleashed drives along the whole front south of Lenin- 
grad, spacing them hundreds of miles apart in order to ex- 
haust Nazi armor and prevent reserves from being combined 
on any front. 

Because the Nazis thought the enemy had engaged all 
his force to take Orel, they were surprised by a simultaneous 
attack on the Kharkov front. They lost the city to a threat 
of double envelopment, the familiar Nazi maneuver which 
had become the Red Army's hammer and sickle. The envel- 
opment of Kharkov began with a Russian breakthrough of 

201 



fifteen to thirty-seven miles north of the city. Soviet tanks, 
with air and artillery support, served as a battering ram 
and the infantry was able to smash through enemy defenses 
[August 4, 1943]. When German tanks covered one gap, 
the Russians broke through again farther west where the 
enemy had no reserves [August 7, 1943]. Then the attack 
shifted quickly to Chuguev, twenty-five miles southeast of 
Kharkov [August 7, 1943]. Soon there was fighting in the 
suburbs of Kharkov, and the Nazis evacuated the city 
[August 12, 1943]. In three columns the Red Army pressed 
them back nearly two hundred miles to the Dnieper [August 
22, 1943]. For the first time Red tanks out-maneuvered 
Nazi tanks to prove that blitzkrieg could oppose blitzkrieg. 

Meanwhile, far to the south at Taganrog in the Donbas, 
Tolbukhin encircled seven enemy divisions with tanks and 
Kuban Cossack cavalry [August 18, 1943]. Although the 
Nazis fought their way out, Taganrog fell, and after it, 
Mariupol [August 30, 1943]. The Russians swung north, 
recaptured the industrial city of Stalino, seventy miles away, 
and advanced west almost to the Dnieper. Malinovsky moved 
forward with another army to a position in front of Dniepro- 
petrovsk [October 5, 1943]. 

North of Kharkov on the Kursk front, Vatutin's army 
advanced rapidly westward, took Konotop [August 26, 
1943], trapped four divisions south of Chernigov, and 
reached the Desna River above Kiev and the Dnieper be- 
low in a pincers formation [September 25, 1943]. Parachute 
troops cleared the intervening area of enemy units at the 
price of heavy losses. A bridgehead was established across 
the Dnieper south of Kiev [October 5, 1943]. 

Below Moscow, Rokossovsky struck west to take Bryansk 
[September 17, 1943], and Sokolovsky drove still farther 
forward to reoccupy the great German base at Smolensk 
[September 25, 1943]. Both cities were important rail junc- 
tions and supply bases lying west of the Desna River, the 
line to which the Germans planned to retreat. The Russians 
took these points by switching the attack from one front to 
another as Nazi reserves vainly tried to stem the tide. They 
failed because they needed to be everywhere at once, for 
the Red armies were strong on all fronts. 

202 



In this summer offensive, during the six weeks after the 
fall of Kharkov, the Red Army liberated an area seven hun- 
dred miles long and as much as 180 miles wide. It became 
imperative for the Germans to make a stand on the Dnieper 
if they hoped to keep any part of their Russian conquests. 

Third Winter Offensive 

The Red Army did not stop. It prepared a winter offensive 
by throwing bridgeheads across the Dnieper. There were sec- 
ondary attacks on the whole front south of Velikie Luki, but 
the main efforts were directed against Gomel, Kiev, and the 
Dnieper Bend. The strategy of the Russian winter offensive 
was dictated by the weak points in the German line of de- 
fense. West of Gomel, on the central front, lay the Pripet 
Marshes, which would split retiring German armies north 
and south and cover the Russian flanks as they advanced 
upon the divided enemy. The key to the southern front was 
Kiev, the rail junction from which the main roads ran into 
the Dnieper Bend. Here the Nazis might be trapped, if 
Kiev fell, and the rich bread-basket of the Ukraine would 
again be Russia's. 

Heavy artillery fire opened operations along the entire 
front [October 7, 1943]. Strong German counterattacks 
failed to prevent Russian reserves from making a bridge- 
head south of Gomel. To the bridgehead already secured 
below Kiev, another was added above the city. The most in- 
tense fighting occurred in the Dnieper Bend [October 17, 
1943], where the Nazis tried to hold their easternmost sali- 
ent. Konev threatened to trap these troops as he crossed be- 
low Kremenchug, but Manstein stopped him with tanks in 
force, supported by over one thousand planes [October 7, 
1943]. Malinovsky crossed the Dnieper on both sides of 
Dniepropetrovsk and forced the enemy to abandon the city 
[October 25, 1943] . Tolbukhin met desperate house-to-house 
fighting in Melitopol, southern anchor of the Nazi line, and 
took the city by envelopment from the north [November 6, 
1943]. The Nazis evacuated the Donbas and fell back one 
hundred miles to the southwestern curve of the lower Dnie- 
per, where they clung to bridgeheads at Nikopol and Kher- 
son. 

203 



The Germans were driven out of Gomel by Rokossovsky's 
surprise pincers movement [November 11, 1943]. First a 
strong attack from the Loev bridgehead cut one of the two 
railroads supplying the city at Rechitsa [November 22, 
1943] ; then with a secret concentration of tanks far to the 
north, he raced into the enemy rear on a front of thirty-eight 
miles and threatened the other railroad [November 25, 
1943]. The large Nazi garrison escaped, despite furious 
Russian attacks, but all the enemy forces were now divided 
by the Pripet Marshes. 

Recapture of Kiev 

In the Ukraine, meanwhile, Vatutin's overwhelming forces 
occupied Kiev [November 6, 1943] after Manstein saved his 
troops from envelopment in the North. A Russian attempt 
to swing south into the Dnieper Bend was repulsed at Fas- 
tov [November 7, 1943]. But other forces fanned westward 
and took the rail junctions of Zhitomir and Korosten [No- 
vember 12, 17, 1943]. A strong Nazi counteroffensive from 
the west and south drove them out, and Red troops in Zhito- 
mir barely escaped encirclement. Nazi artillery and planes 
reduced so many strongpoints west of Kiev that all the Rus- 
sian gains here were imperiled [December 6-11, 1943]. 
With heavy reinforcements, however, the Red Army recap- 
tured Zhitomir and Korosten, and hurled the Germans back 
almost to Poland. One wing of the advancing Russians 
swung southeast to embarrass the Nazis in the Dnieper Bend. 

Here, when Konev's army penetrated to the rail junction 
of Zhnamenka [December 9, 1943], the Germans retired 
from the river between Cherkassy and Kremenchug. To hold 
the exposed northern shoulder of Krivoi Rog, the Nazis 
brought up reserves from the south, and consequently the 
bridgehead at Kherson had to be evacuated [December 20, 
1943] in the face of Tolbukhin's persistent attacks. The 
Nazis still clung to Nikopol, but they were dangerously ex- 
tended at this easternmost point, and the flanks of the 
Dnieper salient were liable to collapse. 

Isolation of the Crimea 

When the Germans withdrew to the Dnieper, they left 
204 



strong forces in the east to control the Black Sea by holding 
the Kuban and Crimea. Through most of 1943 the Russians 
mounted raids and local offensives to clear this region. 
Kleist's perimeter defense of the Kuban was gradually re- 
duced, and finally he evacuated his troops to the Crimea [Oc- 
tober 8-9, 1943] . The Caucasus Mountains and Kuban River 
valley were at last liberated. By withdrawing to the Dnieper 
the Nazis left their troops in the Crimea without any overland 
communications with the main fol-ces. The Red Army seized 
the Perekop Isthmus in the northwest, but their landings in 
the southeast succeeded only in establishing in December a 
beachhead north of Kerch. 

During 1943 the Axis armies had been driven west all 
along the line south of Velikie Luki, except in the Crimea, 
and their positions in the Dnieper Bend became extremely 
precarious. Here 750,000 troops under Manstein risked being 
trapped if the main railroad from Warsaw to Odessa should 
be cut. Military safety depended on a retreat for the sake of 
shortening their lines by hundreds of miles and gaining badly 
needed reserves. But for political reasons Hitler insisted that 
they hold the Dnieper Bend and keep the Russians from en- 
croaching on his satellite states in the Balkans.

PART SIX 
BREAKING THE AXIS 

25. THE UNITED NATIONS FIND STRENGTH 
IN COALITION 

In 1943 the United States, Great Britain, the Soviet Union, 
and China, the leading United Nations, became united in fact 
as well as in name. Their statesmen, generals, and admirals 
traveled the long roads which led to cooperation in military 
strategy and diplomatic policy. Milestones on this road to a 
union of strength were the conferences held at Casablanca, 
Quebec, Moscow, Cairo, and Teheran. Representatives of the 
United States and Great Britain met, together with the Free 
French, at Casablanca; at Quebec and Cairo, China joined 
in the conference. The Soviet Union took part at Moscow 
and Teheran. 

The coming together of the United Nations in these con- 
ferences assured the defeat of the Axis with the greatest speed 
and efficiency, and produced sufficient harmony among them 
to promise a durable peace as well as a quick victory. The 
hopes of the Axis that their enemies would fall out and make 
peace separately for national or class advantage were all 
disappointed. It was fortunate for the United Nations that 
they lived up to their name and achieved a diplomatic tri- 
umph which made possible the military or naval victories to 
come, for only by coalition could the Axis be defeated. The 
United States was the strongest power industrially and in the 
air; Great Britain and America were superior on the sea. But 
the Soviet Union was strongest on land, and China, facing 
Japan, was a bulwark of Asia. No nation could win this global 
war alone. A coalition of the United Nations, with a common 
strategy, pooled resources, and fundamental agreement on 
what the fight was for, was needed to break the Axis. 

I. THE QUEBEC MEETING AND COMBINED STATEGY 

Military strategy, especially in the Far East, was the chief 
business of the conference at Quebec [August 11-24, 1943], 

206 



where President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill met 
with their staffs for the sixth time ; and Cordell Hull, Anthony 
Eden, and T. V. Soong, foreign ministers of the United States, 
Great Britain, and China, came together for the first time. 
Three decisions were made at Quebec which affected the 
European theater of war. The leaders resolved to hasten the 
invasion of Italy because of the collapse of Mussolini and the 
uncertain peace overtures of his successor, Marshal Badoglio. 
Next they agreed to draw the Soviet Union, which was not 
represented at the meetings at Casablanca and Quebec, into 
full concert with the Allied powers. Finally, the French Com- 
mittee of National Liberation, headed by General Charles de 
Gaulle, was recognized as the representative of Free French 
people who were fighting the Axis. 

It was, however, the defeat of Japan by aid to China which 
engaged the most attention at the Quebec Conference. T. V. 
Soong spoke for Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, so that in 
reality an Anglo-American-Chinese strategic conference was 
elaborating the plans made by the Combined Chiefs of Staff 
in May 1943. China-Burma-India came of age as a military 
theater at Quebec. Supreme military command of Southeast 
Asia was vested in Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten, whose 
leadership of combined Commando operations in England 
indicated repetition on a large scale in Burma; Brigadier 
General (now Lieut. General) Albert C. Wedemeyer of the 
U. S. Army was appointed his Deputy Chief of Staff: Lieu- 
tenant General (now General) Joseph W. Stilwell remained 
in command of all Chinese and American ground forces in 
CBI; Major General (now Lieutenant General) George E. 
Stratemeyer became senior air commander; and Major Gen- 
eral (now Lieutenant General) Raymond A. Wheeler the 
principal administrative officer with supervision of supply 
in CBI. The conference approved plans for an offensive early 
in 1944 against the Japanese in northern Burma to facilitate 
the supply of China. The war in the Far East was to be 
waged with increasing force and without any relaxation of the 
war in Europe: this was the answer of combined strategy at 
Quebec to those people in the United States and China who 
still argued that Japan and not Germany was the chief enemy 
of the United Nations. 

207 



II. THE MOSCOW CONFERENCE AND POSTWAR SECURITY 

The meetings at Casablanca and Quebec were primarily 
Anglo-American councils of war to plan offensives against 
Germany and Italy in the Mediterranean and against Japan 
in Asia. At Moscow [October 19-30, 1943] the foreign secre- 
taries of the United States, Great Britain, and the Soviet 
Union reached an agreement on problems of both war and 
peace. To hasten the end of the war, military advisers of the 
Chiefs of Staff discussed preliminary plans for a joint offen- 
sive in Europe. These plans were to be perfected and ap- 
proved later in the year at Teheran. The distinguishing work 
of the Moscow Conference, however was the definition of 
common policies guaranteeing a democratic peace. 

Looking toward this end, two declarations were adopted 
on the treatment of Italy and Austria, setting forth a pro- 
gram that might be applied to all of Europe as it was re- 
leased from Nazi domination. Austria, "the first free country 
to fall a victim of Hitlerite aggression" in 1938, was prom- 
ised freedom and independence. The United Nations gave the 
Austrian people an incentive to break loose from Hitler by 
the assurance that their responsibility for fighting on his side 
would be diminished by what they did to free themselves. 
Austria and the other small countries of Central Europe were 
to be encouraged by their independence "to find that political 
economic security which is the only basis for lasting peace." 

The democratic aims which inspired the United Nations 
in their war against the Axis were stated in the declaration 
on Italy. "Allied policy," it proclaimed, "must be based upon 
the fundamental principle that Fascism and all its evil in- 
fluences and emanations shall be utterly destroyed." Italy, 
like Austria and presumably the other nations of Europe, was 
"to be given every opportunity to establish governmental and 
other institutions based upon democratic principles." The 
distinct emphasis upon "other institutions" besides govern- 
ment indicated that Democracy was not to be limited as in 
the last peace to political arrangements; Fascism was to be 
rooted out of the life and culture of European peoples. 

To insure more than a formal Democracy, the declaration 
specifically provided in the case of Italy that the Democratic 

208 



Bill of Rights should be introduced, with freedom of speech, 
religion, press, assembly, and political association; and that 
all Fascist institutions should be suppressed, Fascist elements 
removed from office, and Fascist chiefs who were "war 
criminals" should be "arrested and handed over to justice." 
Until Allied armies could drive the Germans out of Italy, 
the question of putting these principles into operation was 
left to the Combined Chiefs of Staff. But consultative ma- 
chinery to deal with problems of policy was established in the 
form of an Advisory Council on Italian Affairs and a Euro- 
pean Advisory Commission, composed of civilian representa- 
tives from the United States, Great Britain, and the Soviet 
Union. 

China joined these nations, through its Ambassador at 
Moscow, in the Declaration of Four Nations on General Se- 
curity, the most far-reaching agreement of the Moscow Con- 
ference on both peace and war. The United States, Great 
Britain, China, and the Soviet Union would prosecute the 
war until the Axis Powers "laid down their arms on the 
basis of unconditional surrender." To insure "a rapid and 
orderly transition from war to peace," and to guarantee 
"international peace and security with the least diversion of 
the world's human and economic resources for armaments," 
the four leading United Nations pledged their cooperation in 
peace as in war. They would act together in disarming their 
enemies and enforcing upon them terms of peace; against 
the hostile actions of their enemies the United Nations would 
maintain a common front. 

Among themselves the United States, Great Britain, the 
Soviet Union, and China promised to establish as soon as 
possible "a general international organization, based on the 
principle of the sovereign equality of all peace-loving states, 
and open to membership of all such states, large and small, 
for the maintenance of international peace and security." 
Until order and law prevailed in the world these four nations 
would consult with others and act "on behalf of the com- 
munity of nations." Once the war was ended, however, they 
promised not to use military force in the territories of other 
states except for general security, and then only after joint 
consultation. They would seek, moreover, to reach an agree- 

209 



ment with the United States for ''the regulation of armaments 
in the post-war period." 

The practical effect of these solemn written pledges by the 
four Great Powers fighting the Axis was to assure some kind 
of international organization, open to "all peace-loving 
states" for the security of world-wide peace. This security 
was to be won by defeating and disarming the Axis nations 
and regulating the armaments of all nations. Collaboration 
for peace was to grow out of union for war, but it was not 
to be limited as in war to the strongest nations; military 
alliance for victory in war was to give birth to an association 
of all nations for security in peace. This was the fundamental 
principle to which Great Britain, the Soviet Union, China, 
and the United States subscribed. 

American Indorsement 

In view of what happened after the last war, when the 
American Senate refused to let the United States enter the 
League of Nations, there was considerable doubt at home 
and abroad whether this country would stand by the Moscow 
Declaration after the war was over or revert to a position 
of isolation and extreme nationalism. Such doubt was an- 
swered for the present by the immediate action of the Ameri- 
can Congress. The House of Representatives had adopted the 
Fulbright Resolution [September 21, 1943] by a vote of 360 
to 29, in favor of American participation in "the creation of 
appropriate international machinery with power adequate to 
establish and maintain a just and lasting peace." The 
United States Senate adopted the language of the Moscow 
Conference in passing the Connally Resolution [November 
5, 1943], 85 to 5, in favor of international organization. It 
resolved that "the United States, acting through its constitu- 
tional processes, join with free and sovereign nations in the 
establishment and maintenance of international authority 
with power to prevent aggression and to preserve the peace 
of the world." Although these resolutions do not have the 
force of treaties and would not bind future Congresses, their 
influence might be as great as that of traditional world agree- 
ments. They did constitute an indorsement of the Moscow 
Declaration by the American people.

Mercy and Justice 

Out of the Moscow Conference came a statement on atroci- 
ties, signed by President Roosevelt, Prime Minister Church- 
ill, and Premier Stalin, who warned "the recoiling Hitlerites" 
against "monstrous crimes" committed in desperation as they 
retreated from the Soviet Union, France, and Italy. All 
German soldiers and all Nazis responsible for such atrocities 
would be returned to the countries "in which their abomin- 
able deeds were done, in order that they may be judged and 
punished according to the laws of these liberated countries 
and of free governments which will be erected therein." "Ger- 
man criminals" whose offenses were not localized within a 
single foreign country would be punished by joint decision 
of the Allied Governments. But those who had massacred 
people in Poland, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Nor- 
way, Russia, and Crete would be "judged on the spot by the 
peoples whom they have outraged." 

In language as stern and righteous as the Old Testament 
the enemy was warned against cruel treatment of the people 
of occupied Europe: "Let those who have hitherto not im- 
bued their hands with innocent blood beware lest they join 
the ranks of the guilty, for most assuredly the three Allied 
Powers will pursue them to the uttermost ends of the earth 
and will deliver them to their accusers in order that justice 
may be done." This admonition of justice to come was de- 
signed to obtain mercy for those who had so far survived 
Fascism. 

III. BLUEPRINTS FOR VICTORY: CAIRO, TEHERAN, 
DUMBARTON OAKS, AND YALTA 

The Moscow Conference had been chiefly concerned with 
guarantees of peace for the whole world; the first meeting 
of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek with President Roosevelt 
and Prime Minister Churchill, at Cairo, Egypt, was devoted 
to terms of peace for the Far East [November 22-26, 1943] . 
It was agreed that the war in the Pacific was being fought 
to "restrain and punish the aggression of Japan." The United 
States, Great Britain, and China declared that they coveted 
"no gain for themselves and [had] no thought of territorial 

211 



expansion." But Japan was to ''be stripped of all the islands 
in the Pacific which she has seized or occupied since the 
beginning of the first World War, in 1914," and of all terri- 
tory "stolen from the Chinese" since the first war against 
China in 1894. Land which had once been Chinese, including 
Manchuria and Formosa, was to be restored to China. Japan 
was to "be expelled from all other territories which she has 
taken by violence and greed." Among these, Korea was "in 
due course [to] become free and independent." The United 
States, Great Britain, and China pledged that they would 
carry on the war against Japan until the enemy was brought 
to "unconditional surrender." These territorial terms for Asia 
were specific; nothing so definite had been announced for 
Europe. However, the fate of all the Axis Powers had been 
declared, at Casablanca, Moscow, and Cairo, to be uncondi- 
tional surrender. 

After Cairo came a conference at Teheran, in Iran (Persia) 
[November 26-December 2, 1943], which had been arranged 
during the sessions at Moscow. It was the first face-to-face 
meeting of Stalin with either Roosevelt or Churchill. Out of 
the discussions of their military staffs came "complete agree- 
ment as to the scope and timing of the operations to be 
undertaken from the east, west and south" in 1944 "for the 
destruction of the German forces." Churchill and Roosevelt 
agreed to Stalin's demand for a second front against Ger- 
many in Western Europe, British and American invasion to 
be mounted as one part of a gigantic pincers on German-held 
Europe, the other arm of which would be a Russian drive 
from the east through Poland to Berlin. The diplomatic ad- 
visers of Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin also agreed "to 
make a peace which will command the goodwill of the over- 
whelming mass of the peoples of the world and banish the 
scourge and terror of war for many generations." Thus the 
strategy of war and the goals of peace were shaped in coali- 
tion at Teheran by the United States, Great Britain, and the 
Soviet Union. These were the blueprints of victory. 

The Dumbarton Oaks Plan 

Representatives of the United States, the United King- 
dom, the Soviet Union, and China, meeting, at Dumbarton 
212 



Oaks in Washington, D. C, agreed [October 9, 1944] that 
an international organization should be established by the 
United Nations whose purposes should be: 

1. To maintain international peace and security, to take 
effective collective measures for the prevention and removal 
of threats to the peace and the suppression of acts of ag- 
gression and other breaches of the peace, and to bring about 
by peaceful means adjustment or settlement of international 
disputes which may lead to a breach of the peace ; 

2. To develop friendly relations among nations and to 
take other appropriate measures to strengthen universal 
peace ; 

3. To achieve international cooperation in the solution 
of international economic, social and other humanitarian 
problems; and 

4. To afford a center for harmonizing the actions of 
nations in the achievement of these common ends. 

A charter embodying the principles of the Dumbarton 
Oaks plan was to be drawn up at a future conference of the 
United Nations. 

The Yalta Conference 

On February 12, 1945, announcement was made of the 
conclusion of an eight-day conference between Churchill, 
Roosevelt and Stalin at Yalta on the Crimean Peninsula. 
Final plans for the military defeat of Germany were laid. 
Agreement was reached on policies and plans for enforcing 
the unconditional surrender terms. Separate zones of occu- 
pation were agreed upon. The inflexible purpose of the 
three principal Powers to destroy German militarism and 
the Nazi Party was restated. Swift justice was promised 
for Axis war criminals. A commission was to be set up to 
determine the extent and methods of compensating damage 
caused by Germany to the Allied countries. Announcement 
was made calling for a conference at San Francisco on 
April 25 to draw up a charter for a United Nations Security 
organization on the foundations of the Dumbarton Oaks 
plan. Other agreements were made concerning the control 
of liberated areas and Poland.

26. LIBERATION OF ITALY 

I. THE SICILY campaign: OPERATION HUSKY 

Following the victory in Tunisia, Allied forces prepared 
for two months [May 15- July 9, 1943] to invade and con- 
quer Sicily, Operation Husky. They aimed, as Churchill said, 
at "Axis-held Europe's soft underbelly along the Mediterra- 
nean" and to knock Italy out of the war. Sicily was defended 
by about ten Italian and three German divisions, including 
the 15th Panzer and the Hermann Goering Panzer Divisions, 
and these troops would be reinforced under attack. 

General Eisenhower in supreme command assigned the 
mission of invading Sicily to the Allied 15th Army Group, 
under General Sir Harold Alexander. This group consisted of 
the British Eighth and the American Seventh Armies. The 
Seventh, commanded by Lieutenant General (now General) 
George S. Patton, Jr., was composed of the 1st, 3d, 9th, and 
45th Infantry Divisions, the 82d Airborne, and 2d Armored 
Divisions. These troops were veterans of Tunisia except for 
the 45th, which came directly from the United States. The 
Eighth Army, commanded by General Sir Bernard Mont- 
gomery, was composed of four British infantry divisions, two 
brigades, and an airborne division. In addition, a Canadian 
infantry division was brought in to keep liaison between 
British and American armies. 

Strategy of Landings 

The final plan of attack called for the Americans, sailing 
from North Africa to land on the south central coast of Sicily, 
mop up the western half of the island, and swing east along 
the northern coast to Mount Etna, where the British would 
join them after landing on the southeast and advancing up 
the eastern coast. Then the Allied armies would trap the 
enemy in the northeastern corner of Sicily, cutting off any 
escape to Italy through the Strait of Messina. British and 
American airborne infantry, equal to a division in strength, 
were to land in rear areas and seize -enemy airfields. Unfor- 
tunately, these troops were dropped thirty to fifty miles from 
their objectives [July 9-10, 1943] ; they succeeded in inter- 

214 



fering with enemy communications but failed to capture the 
airfields. 

The night of D-day a huge armada of 3,266 vessels carried 
160,000 men with 1,008 guns and 600 tanks from Africa to 
Sicily [July 10, 1943]. The American troops, seasick in 
choppy waters, landed under cover of naval artillery and 
secured beachheads at Licata, Gela, and Scoglitti [July 11, 
1943] . Next day around Gela one hundred Nazi tanks, spear- 
heads of a counterattack on three sides, threatened to drive 
the Americans into the sea. An artillery barrage knocked out 
many tanks and the stout resistance of the 1st Infantry 
Division repulsed the entire counterattack. East of Gela the 
45th Division captured and held the Biscari airfield after a 
day of bitter fighting [July 14, 1943]. This defeat cost the 
enemy eighty planes and control of the skies over Sicily. 

The British landed from Cape Passero to Syracuse [July 
10, 1943], on the eastern end of a 100-mile front, quickly 
overcame resistance on the beachhead, and occupied the port 
of Syracuse [July 12, 1943]. Then they advanced north 
along the coast beyond Augusta, slowing down as they ap- 
proached Catania. For artillery support the infantry relied 
on naval fire from ships along the coast. The Canadians 
fanned westward to link with the Americans at Ragusa. 

American Advance 

Opposition to the Americans declined after their push 
north to Canicatti, for the Germans realized that they did 
not have strength enough to defend the whole island and 
that the Italians no longer had heart for the fight. Hence 
the enemy held the British on his left and fell back toward 
Mount Etna in the northeast from his right and center, leav- 
ing only one division to cover his withdrawal. This was the 
strategy the Germans had adopted in Tunisia. Their aim was 
to delay and contain the Allies in Sicily and thus prevent 
attacks elsewhere in the Mediterranean. 

The American forces moved with surprising speed over 
difficult country with few roads. Infantry and tanks pushed 
west to take Agrigento [July 22, 1943], then raced north 
across Sicily to seize the port of Palermo [July 30, 1943]. 
The 2d Armored and 3d Infantry Divisions covered seventy- 

215 



two miles in two days. Then, spearheaded by the 45th Divi- 
sion, they fanned east along the northern coastal road to the 
enemy's main line of resistance, which ran southeast from a 
point just west of San Stefano di Camastra to Troina. 

Meanwhile the 1st Infantry Division and the Canadians 
advanced over the hills of central Sicily to capture Nicosia 
and Agira [July 29, 1943]. Here the mountins rose to five 
thousand feet, and the ridge of Troina lay behind a valley in 
which the enemy had demolished the road and built numer- 
ous blocks. Across this valley and up the slopes the 1st In- 
fantry Division attacked Troina in the bitterest assaults of 
the Sicilian campaign [July 29-August 5, 1943]. Bombing 
by A-36s and B-25s and heavy shelling by massed artillery 
in support of an envelopment from the south compelled the 
enemy to withdraw. At the same time, the British outflanked 
Catania on the eastern coast with the capture of Paterno. 
The Axis center broke at Adrano and enemy forces fell back 
into a triangle whose apex was Messina. 

Nazis Retreat 

The German withdrawal was hastened by a new strategy 
which contributed to the subsequent surrender of Italy. 
Hitler and Mussolini had been told by their generals at 
Verona [July 19, 1943] that because the Italian peninsula 
could not easily be defended against Allied naval power, the 
Axis must evacuate Italy to the Po Valley, where a defense 
in depth could be erected for the industrial north. The enemy 
forces were therefore ordered to withdraw from Sicily 
[August 1, 1943] as soon as ships and artillery could be pre- 
pared to cover the crossing of the Strait of Messina. 

Toward this point American and British forces pressed 
from the west and south, across minefields, over roadblocks, 
and through mountain gaps where the cHffs had tumbled 
down under artillery fire. Twice an American force, helped 
by the Navy, made landings in the enemy rear along the 
northern coast. The first time, the German line was cracked 
in a surprise assault [August 8, 1943] by the units which 
landed at Torrenova and captured San Agata di Militello 
[August 11-12, 1943]. Another amphibious assault in bat- 
talion strength was made around Cape Orlando to cut the 

216 



enemy off from his communications south to Randazzo, but 
the heoric landing force faced an enemy which held dominat- 
ing positions in the surrounding hills [August 12, 1943] . Our 
troops suffered heavy losses until the rest of the regiment 
drove through to its support at Brolo. Meanwhile American 
units pressing northeast from the interior captured the key- 
point of Randazzo [August 13, 1943]. 

It was now a race to trap the Nazi before they could 
evacuate all their forces. Combat teams leapfrogged one an- 
other along three routes to Messina. Our air and naval forces 
constantly harassed the enemy's attempt to escape across the 
narrow four-mile Strait of Messina. However, the German 
air umbrella and intense fire from coastal batteries and anti- 
aircraft guns made possible the evacuation of some 88,000 
troops in scores of ferry boats and barges. Among the troops 
successfully evacuated were elements of the Hermann Goer- 
ing Panzer Division which later fought tenaciously in Italy. 
When the American 3d Infantry Division reached Messina, 
followed quickly by British units, the enemy had departed 
into Italy, leaving behind him stores of materiel [August 7- 
16, 1943]. 

Sicily was conquered in thirty-eight days. About 100,000 
prisoners were taken and 12,000 of the enemy were killed or 
wounded. Among the weapons captured or destroyed were 
267 planes and 188 tanks. Allied casualties were some 25,000, 
of which American losses ran to 7,400. The conquest of Sicily 
hastened the collapse of Italy and made the Mediterranean 
Sea more secure for Allied convoys. Italy lay open to inva- 
sion. 

II. SURRENDER OF ITALY 

Italy was first of the Fascist nations to capitulate. Weary 
of war, after three years and three months during which 
Britain with the help of American supplies had conquered 
her whole African empire, Italy surrendered unconditionally 
[September 3, 1943]. The armistice was signed secretly by 
Marshal Pietro Badoglio, named by the King to replace 
Mussolini [July 25, 1943], and a week later official an- 
nouncement came from General Eisenhower. The announce- 
ment was delayed in order to prevent the Nazis from taking 

217 



over Italian defenses before Allied troops could enter through 
the Gulf of Salerno. 

Military Results 

The Germans were not to be caught off guard. Of sixty- 
two divisions in the Italian Army, only nine — in Corsica and 
Sardinia — were left free to surrender to the Allies. Ten 
divisions in the Balkans gave up their arms to Yugoslav 
guerrillas [September 10, 1943]. The Germans disarmed 
forty-three Italian divisions on garrison duty in Italy, France, 
and the Balkans. They also established themselves strongly 
as far south as Naples, with lighter forces to the end of the 
Italian peninsula, seized the naval ports of Genoa and Spezia, 
and rescued Mussolini from confinement in Abruzzi Pro- 
vince in a daring raid by parachutists who spirited him away 
to his German overlord. 

The Italian Army was out of the war, but the chief mili- 
tary gain to the Allies was the acquisition of the Italian 
Navy. Although the Nazis sank one battleship and seized ten 
cruisers, ten destroyers, and many submarines, the bulk of 
the Navy, following Badoglio's orders, sailed into Allied 
ports [September 10-12, 1943]. Among the vessels which 
arrived at Malta were six battleships, eight cruisers, twenty- 
seven destroyers, and nineteen submarines. No longer were 
Allied warships contained within the Mediterranean Sea by 
the passive threat of the Italian fleet; additional vessels 
could now be sent to patrol Indian and Pacific waters against 
Japan. 

Why Italy Surrendered 

The surrender of Italy resulted from war weariness inside 
the country and AlHed military pressure outside. The attempt 
to detach Italy from the Axis was decided upon [May 11, 
1943] by President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill 
in the conference at Washington following the conquest of 
Tunisia. Roosevelt urged the Italian people [June 11, 1943] 
to overthrow Mussolini and the Fascists, and to expel the 
Nazis, promising them that they would be free to choose 
their own government, provided it was not Fascist; Churchill 
threatened the Italians with ruin if they did not abandon 

218 



Mussolini and surrender [June 30, 1943]. When Allied 
troops swept into Sicily and Allied bombers struck at Italian 
ports and communications, crowds in the northern cities 
shouted for peace. 

The growing unrest of the people threatened rebellion until 
a palace plot forestalled it by ousting Mussolini. He had 
appealed to Hitler for protection against the Allies [July 19, 
1943], but at a military conference Hitler persuaded him to 
defend only the industrial heart of the country, in the north 
along the Po River [July 24, 1943]. When Mussolini pre- 
sented this plan to the Fascist Grand Council, he was de- 
nounced by Count Dino Grandi and voted down by nine- 
teen of the twenty-five councillors. King Victor Emmanuel 
appointed Marshal Badoglio to take the lealership of the 
Government. After twenty-one years of dictatorship, Musso- 
lini was thrown out. 

The fall of Mussolini surprised Hitler, but his General 
Staff realized that Italy would get out of the war. They pre- 
pared for this event by ordering the evacuation of Sicily and 
the reinforcement of Nazi units in Italy so that they could 
take over the country [July 29- August 5, 1943] . When Mus- 
solini fell, Allied bombers stopped raiding Italian cities to 
give Marshal Badoglio "breathing space" in which to make 
peace. When the Nazis took advantage of the respite to move 
into Italy, the aerial offensive was resumed [August 1, 1943]. 

Political Stalemate in Italy 

Badoglio, like the King, was almost a prisoner of the Nazi 
troops in Italy. He could not easily deliver the country to the 
Allies, whose bombers flew overhead but whose troops were 
still in Sicily. To make matters worse, he pursued an un- 
democratic policy which failed to give the people who wanted 
peace any voice in the government. He tried to get rid of 
Fascism by dissolving the party and incorporating its militia 
into the Army, but he indicted none of the Fascist leaders. 
At the same time he endeavored to suppress popular agita- 
tion by declaring martial law and putting a ban on all poli- 
tical meetings. [July 26-30, 1943]. 

Strikes broke out in Genoa, Turin, and Milan [August 3- 
19, 1943]. Workers demanded an immediate change from 

219 



war to peace production in all factories, the revocation of 
martial law, and the release of political prisoners. Badoglio 
compromised. He abolished the ban on labor unions by sup- 
pressing the Fascist employers' corporations [August 10, 
1943], and arranged an armistice under which labor agreed 
to call off general strikes [September 2, 1943] and he prom- 
ised to seek peace with the Allies. The rising of the Italian 
people in the north hastened the surrender made inevitable 
by the military victory in Sicily. 

Yet Italy surrendered too late to gain peace. The Nazis 
occupied the country and deprived all soldiers of their arms. 
Italy was not to be free of war until the Allied armies drove 
out the Nazi intruders. 

III. INVASION OF ITALY: OPERATION AVALANCHE 

After Sicily came Italy. With the fall of Mussolini the 
Allies hastened preparations to invade Italy before the coun- 
try could be taken over by quislings or occupied completely 
bv the Germans. The separation of Italy from the Axis was 
the goal of Allied strategy in the Mediterranean, from the 
landings in North Africa to the conquest of Sicily, because it 
would knock the weakest Axis partner out of the war, dis- 
pose of the Italian Navy, open the whole Mediterranean Sea 
to Allied shipping, weaken Nazi control of the Balkans, and 
furnish southern bases for an Allied aerial offensive against 
German-held Europe. To attain these objectives the Allied 
Fifteenth Army Group under General Alexander planned to 
invade Italy at three points. The first landings were to be 
made by the British Eighth Army at Reggio di Calabria and 
Taranto to prevent the Germans from establishing them- 
selves firmly in southern Italy and to give the Allies control 
over the Adriatic ports. The major assault was to be in the 
Gulf of Salerno where the Fifth Army would attempt to 
establish a firm base for future operations to cut off German 
troops withdrawing to the north in front of the Eighth Army, 
and to seize Naples. The Eighth Army, after clearing south- 
ern Italy, would swing north to drive up the eastern half of 
the Denmsula parallel with the Fifth Army on the west. 

Two divisions of the British Eighth Army, commanded by 
General Montgomery, crossed from Messina to Reggio di 

220 



Calabria at the toe of Italy [September 3, 1943 \ under cover 
of four battleships and the concentrated fire of four hundred 
guns lined up on the Sicilian shore. With this support the 
British advanced up the Calabrian coast, meeting little op- 
position. The British 1st Airborne Division occupied the 
naval base of Taranto [September 9, 1943] after the sur- 
render of Italy, struck northward to Bari and closed the 
Adriatic Sea. 

Landings at Salerno 

The Fifth Army, commanded by Lieutenant General Mark 
W. Clark, was chosen to make the principal assault on the 
Italian mainland. British and American units organized into 
two corps were to land in the Gulf of Salerno, advance in- 
land to secure a firm beachhead some twenty-six miles wide 
and ten miles deep, then wheel to the north for a drive 
through the mountains to capture Naples and the communi- 
cation center of Benevento. Salerno was chosen, among other 
reasons, because it was the northernmost point at which 
fighter planes based on Sicily, some two hundred miles 
south, could provide an air umbrella. A speedy junction be- 
tween the Fifth Army and the British Eighth Army might 
result in trapping enemy forces south of Naples. 

Convoys bearing the invasion forces put out from ports in 
Africa and Sicily [September 8, 1943]. As the armada ap- 
proached Salerno, General Eisenhower made the startling 
announcement that Italy had signed an armistice. Although 
some of the men then felt that the invasion might prove to be 
another "dry run," there were definite indications that the 
landings would be heavily opposed. An enemy reconnaissance 
plane had discovered the convoys off Salerno [September 8, 
1943], and by the time the ships were at anchor waiting for 
H-hour, the Germans were on the alert. They had disarmed 
nearly all of the Italian units manning the coastal defenses 
and were now compelled to dispose their forces thinly in 
order to guard the long coast line. 

No naval bombardment had been planned to soften the 
shore defenses, partly because it was hoped that surprise 
might be achieved. When our first assault waves hit th** 
beaches at 0330 on September 9, they were met by heavy fire 

221 



from machine guns, 88mms. and mortars. In the British sec- 
tor a last-minute naval preparation was fired, but the initial 
American landings were made without such support. 

In the British X Corps zone north of the Sele River, re- 
sistance was especially bitter and the two assault divisions 
suffered heavy casualties in their advance toward the Mon- 
tecorvino airfield and Battipaglia. Rangers and Commandos, 
attached to the X Corps, landed on the army left flank and 
quickly secured key mountain passes leading to the city of 
Salerno and the plain east of the gulf. Their success in hold- 
ing these passes during the following critical week was an 
important factor in defending the beachhead against furious 
German counterattacks. In the center of the X Corps zone, 
the British pushed advance units of an infantry division 
into Battipaglia [September 12, 1943] ; but the Germans 
counterattacked, threw back our assault, and kept possession 
of that important rail and highway junction. 

South of the Sele U. S. VI Corps landed on beaches near 
the ancient Greek temples of Paestum, with the 36th In- 
fantry Division, reinforced, in the lead [September 9, 1943]. 
Here the 16th Panzer Division had been in position two 
weeks before the landings. Most of the assault waves broke 
through the barrier of wire, mines, and fire from automatic 
weapons and reached the coastal highway by dawn. From 
daylight until afternoon the panzers tried to disrupt the 
landing by attacking the beachhead with small groups of 
tanks, but our artillery, naval gunfire, dive bombers, and 
infantry defeated these efforts [September 10, 1943]. Soon 
our troops were pushing out rapidly to the south and east 
to enlarge the beachhead, and two combat teams of the 45th 
Infantry Division were unloading to reinforce the 36th 
Division. 

Failure of German Counterattacks 

Expansion of the beachhead continued against steadily 
mounting enemy resistance. The Germans now had the 16th, 
26th, and Hermann Goering Panzer Divisions, the 15th and 
29th Panzer Grenadier Divisions, and elements of the 3d 
Panzer Grenadier Division in the Salerno area. These units 
launched counterattacks [September 11, 1943] with increas- 

222 



ing intensity during the next two days. On the Fifth Army's 
left, the British repelled every German attempt to drive 
them into the sea but could not completely close the gap 
between the Sele River and their main body. Here the 
American 45th Division became involved in a seesaw strug- 
gle for a tobacco factory east of Persano, a keypoint north 
of the river. 

German counterattacks increased in fury [September 12- 
13, 1943]. Our troops had to fall back, and for a time the 
German drive threatened to force a wedge through to the 
beaches; All available units were thrown into the defense; 
the 36th Division on the south and the 45th Division on the 
north established a firm line. Tank-destroyer, artillery, and 
naval fire crashed unceasingly upon the Germans and our 
Air Forces bombed and strafed their communications and 
positions. At the peak of the Nazi counterattack all the 
Allied air forces, including heavy bombers, threw their weight 
into the battle. In one day the Northwest African Air 
Force flew 1,888 sorties over the beachhead. Thirty-six B-25 
bombers endeavored to cut off the 16th Panzer Division by 
cratering the key highways. Africa-based B-17s and B-26s 
hit road junctions to break up enemy divisions descending 
on the beachhead. Saturation raids were made on the Nazi 
airfields at Foggia. By September 15 the counterattacks had 
spent their force. Three days later the enemy began to with- 
draw toward the north, with both Fifth and Eighth Armies 
in pursuit. We had won the Battle of Salerno and our line 
stretched across Italy to Bari. 

Capture of Naples and Foggia 

With quick, heavy blows the Fifth Army punched back 
the German right wing, taking Oliveto [September 23, 1943], 
and Nocera [September 27, 1943], and drove the enemy 
from the mountains shielding Naples. The Nazis retired 
north through the city, shooting civilian snipers, demol- 
ishing the port, destroying the water supply, mining build- 
ings, and removing everything on wheels [October 1, 1943]. 
The Fifth Army occupied Naples [October 1^ 1943], aided 
by a civilian uprising, and pushed on to the new enemy de- 
fenses along the steep northern banks of the Volturno River. 

223 



Total American losses thus far, including the Salerno casual- 
ties, were 511 killed, 5,428 wounded, and 2,367 missing. 

Meanwhile the British Eighth Army captured the great 
airfields of Foggia [September 27, 1943] and moved north 
to Termoli on the Adriatic coast. This advance threatened 
the enemy line westward along the Volturno. By an amphi- 
bious assault [October 1, 1943], Commandos in the enemy 
rear attempted to cut behind Termoli. The Nazis counter- 
attacked against the landing force [October 6-7, 1943], and 
with reinforcements from the 16th Panzer Division, struck 
at the British lines until their own tanks were whittled down. 
Then the Eighth Army broke through [October 9-10, 1943], 
with the help of enfilading fire from destroyers on the coast, 
and made contact with their Commandos. Since the advance 
was bound to be slow along the steep Adriatic coast, where 
mountains came down to the sea, the main drive was shifted 
to the interior along the Apennine Mountains. Here the 
British moved forward slowly [October 9-15, 1943] to a line 
extending from Larino west to Campobasso, where they 
were abreast of the Americans on their left. 

Crossing the Volturno 

After Fifth Army engineers reclaimed the port of Naples, 
supplies and ammunition poured in for the coming battle at 
the Volturno. The attack began with heavy artillery fire and 
an amphibious sally [October 12-13, 1943] by X Corps 
against the enemy rear on the Tyrrhenian coast. From the 
coast to the Calore River, bridgeheads were established 
across the Volturno [October 14, 1943] . Capua, in the center, 
changed hands several times in tank and infantry engage- 
ments [October 13-14, 1943]. Within two days the enemy 
was compelled to withdraw from his delaying positions north 
of the Volturno under pressure which had forced both flanks 
back three miles. 

After crossing the Volturno the Fifth Army met several 
stubborn rearguards covering the German withdrawal to 
positions already partly prepared in the mountains at the 
head of the Volturno Valley. Every bridge and culvert had 
been blown by the enemy ; bypasses were mined, and demoli- 
tions were defended by small enemy units. There were sev- 

224 



eral sharp engagements but no great battles until the Fifth 
Army struck the Winter Line early in November. By this 
time the fall rains had flooded the valleys and turned second- 
ary roads into quagmires. From one side of Italy to the 
other, Allied troops had to overcome difficult problems of 
supply as well as enemy opposition. 

Fighting Through the Winter Line 

The Winter Line was a series of positions in depth located 
in extremely rough mountains. On the far west was the 
Garigliano River. In the center were the highest peaks of the 
Apennines. East of this principal range the Sangro River 
marked the main German position in front of the Eighth 
Army. 

Patrols of the Eighth Army reached and crossed the San- 
gro River on November 8. The army then consolidated its 
bridgeheads in preparation for crossing the Moro River and 
attacking Orsogna and Ortona. On December 5 it reached 
the Moro, crossed four days later, and assaulted Ortona. This 
city fell at the end of the month after two weeks of street 
fighting [December 27, 1943]. In November, General Clark's 
troops had made preliminary attempts to break the Winter 
Line and now paused to bring up supplies and to relieve the 
battle-weary 3d and 34th Divisions by elements of the II 
Corps. The assault was unleashed by the X and II Corps 
against the Camino hills [December 1-2, 1943]. After clear- 
ing these mountain fortresses of enemy troops [December 9, 
1943], the X Corps rested while the II and VI Corps contin- 
ued the struggle. Troops of liberated Italy entered the battle 
against the Germans on December 6. At the same time the 
36th Division, under command of the II Corps, attacked San 
Pietro in a bloody battle that ended successfully after nine 
days of fighting. In the mountains farther north, the 45th 
Division could make little progress. 

There were few changes in our lines during the rest of 
December. The French Expeditionary Corps, commanded by 
General Alphonse Juin, began to relieve the VI Corps in 
January. Then the II Corps resumed its drive and by mid- 
January had broken through the Winter Line in a drive that 

225 



carried the main German defenses south of Rome — the 
Gustav Line. 

The rest of the winter the Allies were stalemated along the 
Gustav Line. Terrain and weather gave the Nazis every 
advantage in fighting a long delaying action to hold the 
Allies south of Rome. However, continuing the Italian cam- 
paign was important in Allied strategy because this cam- 
paign weakened other enemy fronts, robbing them of twenty 
divisions. Italy was a secondary theater with the primary 
mission of consuming enemy strength while the Russians 
pushed forward in the east and preparations were made in 
England for the invasion of Europe from the west. 

IV. THE GUSTAV LINE AND ANZIO 

In the first three months of 1944, the Fifth Army tried 
twice to break through the strong enemy defenses and cap- 
ture Rome. One attempt was to turn the Gustav Line by a 
landing fifty miles north at Anzio on the Tyrrhenian coast. 
The other was to cut through the line beyond Cassino. 
Neither operation was wholly successful; but each tested 
American, British, and French troops with the toughest pro- 
longed fighting they had met in the Mediterranean theater. 

The Gustav Line 

Cassino was a key position in the Gustav Line. The town 
and its dominating hills barred the entrance into the Liri 
River Valley — the road to Rome. Another road to Rome 
runs along the Tyrrhenian coast, following roughly the old 
Appian Way. General Alexander planned the Gustav Line 
operation to clear each of these highways. The main effort 
was thrown against the German positions protecting the 
highway in the Liri Valley. 

Rome was the objective of the Gustav Line campaign, and 
the Liri Valley was the most logical avenue of approach. This 
valley is flanked on both the north and the south by huge 
mountain masses and is bounded on the west by the Gari- 
gliano, Gari, and Rapido Rivers. Minefields and wire guard- 
ed the rivers on each side. Steel "crabs," portable pillboxes, 

226 



were staggered in depth in the mountains and across the Liri 
Valley west of the Rapido. Reinforced concrete pillboxes, 
often built in stone houses and on mountain sides, were all 
but impregnable positions. 

The 15th Army Group's strategy for the January of- 
fensive called for the British X Corps on the Fifth Army's 
left to force a crossing of the Garigliano River with two di- 
visions, establish a bridgehead, then wheel north to cross 
the Liri River. These maneuvers were planned to force the 
Germans to fall back from the Rapido line south of Cassino. 
In two more attacks on successive nights, one division of the 
X Corps was to cross the Garigliano near its junction with 
the Gari River, and the 36th Division was to make a frontal 
assault on Sant' Angelo. The next day, the VI Corps was to 
land at Anzio in the enemy's rear to cut his lines of com- 
munication south of Rome. Following the Rapido assault, 
the 34th Division and the French Corps would cross the 
Rapido north of Cassino, then turn south to outflank the 
town. The enemy was already off balance because of several 
shifts of his forces; it was hoped that these moves would 
compel him to withdraw north of Rome. 

The assault by the X Corps was successful at first. Within 
four days [January 17-21, 1944] the British gained a sub- 
stantial bridgehead west of the Garigliano, but they could 
not break through to the Liri River. The 36th Division, 
crossing the Rapido River, met enemy opposition so intense 
that our troops fell back to their original positions [January 
20-23, 1944] after suffering very heavy casualties. At the 
end of January the 34th Division crossed successfully and 
breached the north end of the Gustav Line. [January 29-31, 
1944]. The French Corps at the same time paralleled this 
advance and captured several key hills east of Mount Cairo, 
the snow-capped peak which dominates the entire Cassino 
area. 

Struggle for Cassino 

The battle for Cassino itself began when the 34th Divi- 
sion and a combat team of the 36th Division drove on the 
town from the north [February 1, 1944]. Our troops fought 

227 



their way into the north edge of town and in twelve days 
had captured several hills north and northwest of Hill 516, 
on which stood the venerable Benedictine Monastery. A 
handful of our troops actually reached the walls of the mona- 
stery but were compelled to withdraw by German reinforce- 
ments. 

The New Zealand Corps, formed initially by bringing to- 
gether the 2d New Zealand Division and the 4th Indian 
Division, joined the Fifth Army and began to relieve the II 
Corps early in February. On the day that the New Zealand 
Corps took over the battle a heavy bombing raid partially 
destroyed the Monastery {February 15, 1944]. The 2d New 
Zealand Division then captured about one-third of Cassino, 
but the 4th Indian Division could no no more than hold its 
positions. The drive to complete the conquest of Cassino was 
postponed until March, when another bombing raid by about 
five hundred planes again blasted the Cassino stronghold. 
When the New Zealanders attacked after extremely heavy 
artillery concentrations, they found that the bombing had 
cratered the roads and blocked the streets with debris. 
Tanks, therefore, could not be used effectively. The German 
1st Parachute Division fought viciously under direct orders 
from Hitler to hold at all costs. Indian troops captured 
Castle Hill (Hill 193), Hill 165, and Hangman's Hill (Hill 
435) just below the Monastery [March 15-20, 1944]. But 
the Monastery held out, as did isolated strong points in 
Cassino. The New Zealand Corps called off the battle again 
[March 23, 1944], and General Alexander waited until May 
to resume the drive. These failures along the Gustav Line 
prevented the Fifth Army from connecting with the Anzio 
beachhead. 

Anzio Beachhead 

To turn the Gustav Line and to facilitate the capture of 
Rome, a landing had been made by two divisions, and the 
U.S. 3d Infantry Division, on the west coast at Nettuno and 
Anzio [January 22, 1944]. These resort villages are on a fiat 
beach thirty-six miles south of Rome, fifty miles north of 
Cassino, and only twenty miles west of the enemy's lines of 

228 



communication between these points. The violent attack on 
Cassino preoccupied the Germans and enabled British and 
American units of the Fifth Army to surprise them by the 
flank assault on Anzio. Very little resistance was encountered 
at first as patrols advanced through Aprilla toward Cam- 
polene [January 25, 1944], sixteen miles below Rome, and 
inland to only seven miles from the Appian Way at Cisterna 
[February 2, 1944]. Against growing enemy resistance the 
Allies supplied and reinforced the beachhead, British units 
and the American 45th Division arriving to hold the position. 
The Nazis soon hemmed in the beachhead with elements of 
six divisions, including Fascist Italians, under General Mack- 
ensen. They swept the low-lying Allied positions with en- 
filaded batteries, and fired on supply vessels, using 170mm. 
guns posted in the mountains inland. The enemy rear was 
beyond range of Allied guns, and the beachhead was so nar- 
row and crowded that almost any enemy bomb or shell found 
a target, and German artillery raked it day and night. Amer- 
ican soldiers on the beachhead walked with the "Anzio gait," 
hugging walls and crouching along on bent knees, but the 
work of supply never stopped [February 3-9, 1944]. Strong 
Nazi counterattacks by tank-and-infantry teams chopped at 
the northern British flank until Aprilia fell. There the enemy 
was halted by British tanks [February 16-17, 1944], an 
American sidesweep coming westward from Cisterna, the 
concentrated fire of naval vessels on his flanks, and the 
whole Air Forces over his lines. 

After fruitless counterattacks the Allies organized a peri- 
meter defense of the beachhead. This was actually a triangle 
with its base running nineteen miles along the coast and its 
apex inland about two miles southwest of Cisterna. Over 
this area both sides were harassed by constant shelling, some 
bombing, and frequent raids. A final Nazi attack on the 
American sector was repelled [March 2, 1944]. The Anzio 
beachhead stood, a thorn in the enemy's side, engaging his 
tactical reserves. But it had failed either to turn his defenses 
in the south around Cassino or to open a breakthrough north 
to Rome. The Allies had not enough ships or men in the 
Italian theater to develop and extend the beachhead. 

229 



27. AMERICAN ADVANCE IN THE PACIFIC 

On the other side of the world from Italy, in the tropical 
jungles of the Southwest Pacific, the fighting was as tough 
as in the mountains around Cassino. And progress on the 
road to Tokyo seemed at times as slow and difficult as on 
the road to Rome. 

Operations in the South Pacific during 1942 had been 
confined to Guadalcanal and Buna because of limited re- 
sources. As Allied strength in this area grew through the 
winter of 1942-43, the commanding officers of the Central, 
South, and Southwest Pacific met in Washington [March 
1943] to make plans for an offensive which would roll up 
the Japanese outposts. After the reduction and mopping up 
of Guadalcanal and Buna early in 1943, there was a period 
of apparent stalemate, during which American forces and 
supplies were accumulated in the Pacific to penetrate the 
outer defenses of the Japanese Empire. The larger part of 
all American military and naval forces overseas in the middle 
of 1943 were stationed in the Pacific. They were divided be- 
tween two theaters, with most of the land forces in the South- 
west Pacific under General Douglas MacArthur, and most 
of the naval forces in the Central Pacific under Admiral 
Chester W. Nimitz. In each theater a great amphibious 
offensive was launched by all arms combined against the 
Pacific islands held by the Japanese. 

I. CLIMBING THE SOLOMONS-NEW GUINEA LADDER 

The amphibious forces advancing up the Solomons-New 
Guinea ladder were not engaged, as the press put it, in 
"island-hopping." The oceanic highway to Tokyo was too 
long a road for the Americans to take every island which 
the Japanese had occupied. "We have been moving," said 
Admiral Nimitz, "not from island to island, but, from one 
area to another to get naval bases. In effect, we have simply 
been expanding our sea-power control westward in order to 
enable us to get on." 

The key Japanese base in the Southwest Pacific, covering 
sea routes north to the Philippines, which General Mac- 
Arthur was pledged to reconquer, was the port of Rabaul 

230 



in the northeastern corner of New Britain Island. It sup- 
ported and was protected by numerous airfields and naval 
patrol bases which the enemy had established around the 
Bismarck Archipelago off the northeast shore of New Guinea, 
the Admiralty Islands, New Ireland, and the Solomons. To 
reach Rabaul by air and outflank it by land, a two-pronged 
offensive was mounted by AlHed forces. On land, American 
and Australian troops under General MacArthur, supplied 
in part by the U.S. Fifth Air Force under Lieutenant Gen- 
eral George C. Kenney, advanced up the eastern coast of 
New Guinea. At the same time, American troops, with the 
support of the task forces under Admiral Halsey's South 
Pacific command, took island after island in the Solomons. 
As they climbed the Solomons-New Guinea ladder toward 
Rabaul, the U.S. Fifth Air Force from Australia and New 
Guinea combined with the Thirteenth Air Force from New 
Caledonia and Guadalcanal to pound Rabaul to pieces. Air 
and naval forces together covered all landings and inter- 
cepted Japanese supply and warships in the waters of the 
Southwest Pacific, ranging in 1944 as far north as Java, 
Borneo, and the Palau and Truk island groups. 

New Georgia Campaign 

The advance in the Solomons started from Guadalcanal, 
where fighter planes were based on Henderson Field, and 
proceeded first toward enemy air bases about two hundred 
miles north, at Munda on New Georgia Island and near 
the Vila River on Kolombangara Island. The Japanese con- 
centrated so much air power at these fields in the northern 
Solomons that our air and naval bombardments were unable 
permanently to destroy them [January 23-24, 1943, March 
5-6, 1943, May 12-13, 1943] . American amphibious forces 
landed in the Russell Islands group to provide an air strip 
for fighter planes sixty miles northwest of Guadalcanal 
[February 21, 1943]. As preparations were made for the 
invasion of New Georgia, the Japanese put up furious op- 
position in the air. Over Guadalcanal, in one of the greatest 
engagements of the Southwest Pacific [June 16, 1943], 107 
enemy craft were shot down by Army, Navy, and Marine 
Corps pilots who lost only six planes. 

231 



The U. S. 43rd Infantry Division moved to Rendova 
Island, off Munda, while Marines landed at Viru Harbor 
[June 30, 1943] . Covered by fighter planes, which shot down 
over a hundred Japanese craft, both forces quickly overcame 
the enemy garrisons. [July 2-3, 1943], From the landings 
which followed on New Georgia, at Rice Anchorage, and else- 
where, troops of the XIV Corps (the 37th, 24th, and 25th 
Infantry Divisions) converged on the enemy air base at 
Munda [August 5, 1943]. It fell after six weeks of hard 
fighting during which some 350 Japanese planes were de- 
stroyed with a loss of 93 American planes. The enemy held 
out at Bairoko Harbor, eight miles north, for another three 
weeks [August 25, 1943]. 

. The Japanese airbase at Vila on Kolombangara was neu- 
tralized as soon as Seabees had rebuilt the Munda air strip 
for American operation [August 15, 1943]. Kolombangara 
was finally bypassed with the landing of Army, Marine and 
New Zealand forces on Vella Lavella Island [August 15, 
1943] fourteen miles northwest, and was brought under 
artillery fire from Arundel, occupied somewhat later [August 
27, 1943]. The Japanese lost heavily in both ships and men 
as they made attempts first to reinforce and then to evacuate 
New Georgia and Kolombangara. In the close naval battles 
of Kula Gulf [July 6, 13, 1943] and Vella Gulf, in August, 
American cruisers and destroyers sank three enemy destroy- 
ers and a cruiser, and damaged another force, but lost the 
cruiser Helena, the destroyer Gwin, and suffered damage to 
three other cruisers [August 6, 1943]. Baanga and Arundel 
Islands were occupied by elements of the 25th and 43rd In- 
fantry Divisions [September 22, 1943] . There were also 
destroyer actions off Vella Gulf, Vella Lavella and Kolomban- 
gara, with a total of nine Japanese warships sunk [October 
6, 1943]. 

Bougainville Campaign 

The conquest of the northern Solomons centered on Bou- 
gainville Island, which was approached by landing just to 
the south of it at Mono and Stirling in the Treasury Islands 
[October 26-27, 1943]. While the main forces under Lieu- 
tenant General (now General) Alexander A. Vandergrift 

232 



landed on the west coast of Bougainville at Empress Augusta 
Bay [November 1, 1943], a battalion of Marine Raiders 
made a feint against Japanese positions on Choiseul Island. 
A large enemy force of cruisers and destroyers tried to break 
up this advance to Bougainville but were dispersed with con- 
siderable damage by an American force under Rear Admiral 
A. S. Merrill [November 2, 1943]. The 148th Infantry of 
the U.S. 37th Division reinforced the Marines at Empress 
Augusta Bay [November 8, 1943], and additional troops 
landed during the next two months at the base established 
on Cape Torokina. Though the enemy was too strong to be 
destroyed in combat, land-based bombers neutralized his air- 
fields in the Buka-Bonis area of northern Bougainville, and 
American cruisers and destroyers shelled his coastal positions. 
Instead of slugging it out with the Japanese on Bougain- 
ville as in the slow and costly operation on Guadalcanal, the 
Americcin command took advantage of its naval and air su- 
periority to contain the enemy garrisons on Bougainville and 
cut their supply lines to Rabaul by occupying the Green 
Islands just north of the Solomons [February 14, 1944]. 
This jump forward isolated all the Japanese forces left in 
the Solomons, at Bougainville, Choiseul, Shortland, and Buka 
Inlands. They did not cease resistance, but they were no 
longer strategically effective as fighting troops. The Solomons 
were at last completely dominated by American air and naval 
power. 

New Guinea Campaign 

On the other side of the Solomons-New Guinea ladder, 
American, Australian, and New Zealand troops of General 
MacArthur's command moved north from one strategic point 
to the next with the goal of outflanking and isolating the 
main Japanese base at Rabaul. Progress in New Guinea 
was slower than in the Solomons, because the country was 
larger and more rugged, with jungle swamps along the coast 
and unmapped mountains inland, and in this difficult terrain 
the enemy held all strategic Dositions in force. The chief 
burden of the fighting in New Guinea was borne by the Aus- 
tralian 7th and 9th and the American 3 2d and 41st Divi- 
sions, paratroopers were frequently used as assault battalions 

233 



to cut off enemy positions in the mountains, and the U.S. 
Fifth Air Force often acted as a service of supply to remote 
outposts. American units were organized in the Sixth Army 
under Lieutenant General Walter Krueger. All these Allied 
forces in the Southwest Pacific were nearly equal in numbers 
and strength to the Allied armies in Italy, proof of the im- 
portance and difficulty of their operations. 

After the enemy lost his southernmost outposts at Buna 
and Sanananda [January 19, 1943], he did not give up 
New Guinea. From Rabaul he sent reinforcements to his gar- 
risons at Lae and Salamaua. These convoys were heavily 
attacked by Allied bombers \ January 6-9, 1943]. In the 
Battle of the Bismarck Sea [March 1-3, 1943] it was esti- 
mated that eighteen enemy ships with fifteen thousand troops 
aboard were sunk by Flying Fortresses and Liberators which 
trailed and bombed them for three days. The Japanese in- 
creased their air strength from Rabaul to Salamaua until it 
was reported that they had twice as many planes in this 
area as the Fifth Air Force. Flights of a hundred or more 
bombers struck Allied supply depots at Port Moresby, Oro 
and Milne Bay in New Guinea, and at Port Darwin in Aus- 
tralia [March 15, April 12, 14, May 2, 1943]. The U.S. 
Fifth and Thirteenth Air Forces, aided by planes from naval 
carrier forces, hit back and wore down the enemy air strength 
centered at Rabaul, in a relentless offensive that lasted 
through the winter and spring of 1943. 

From Salamaua to Madang 

The advance on Rabaul bv land had begun simultane- 
ously in the Solomons and New Guinea, so that the enemy 
had his hands too full to deal with both offensives ade- 
quately. In surprise landings we gained without opposition 
air strips on the Woodlark and Trobriand Islands [June 30, 
1943], which lie between the Solomons and New Guinea. 
From their main base at Salamaua, however, the Japanese 
had crept toward the strategic center of lower New Guinea 
in the Bulolo Valley. Here they were turned back by the 
Australian 6th Division which was flown into the jungle. 
After nine months these troops had pushed the enemy back 
from Wau to the coast. The base at Salamaua was now 

234 



flanked by Americans landing to the south at Nassau Bay 
and by Australian reinforcements put ashore at Tambu Bay 
[June 29, 30, 1943]. After hard fighting overland, remi- 
niscent of Buna, Salamaua was invested by combined artil- 
lery and occupied by American and Australian troops [Sep- 
tember 11, 1943]. 

Airborne and amphibious units of the Australian 9th Divi- 
sion jumped across the Gulf of Huon to capture Lae [Sep- 
tember 16, 1943], which was then converted like Salamaua 
into a forward air and naval base. Allied amphibious forces 
moved by sea to take the next objective, Finschhafen [Octo- 
ber 2, 1943], at the eastern end of the Huon Peninsula. The 
Japanese spread inland from these coastal points, and only 
after three months of bitter fighting through the mountain 
jungles were they driven out of Huon. Large numbers were 
caught in the Markham River Valley between the 9th Aus- 
tralians pushing up the coast from Lae and the 7th Austra- 
lians driving down the valley [September 16, 1943]. Amer- 
ican paratroopers and Australian artillery, dropped on Nad- 
zab in the rear of the enemy, drove north under air cover 
to clear the Markham and Ramu valleys and to corner the 
Japanese in the foothills of the Finisterre Range before Ma- 
dang. Here the enemy made a prolonged and stubborn stand. 
In order to encircle the Japanese, units of the U. S. 3 2d 
Division landed without losses at Saidor [January 2, 1944], 
fifty-five miles below Madang, and met Australian troops 
who had pushed up the coast from Finschhafen and Sio 
[February 13, 1944]. This junction of Allied forces com- 
pleted the conquest of the Huon Peninsula and, with the 
occupation of Umboi Island [February 12, 1944], covered 
the flank of American troops who had moved into western 
New Britain. 

Neutralization of Rabaul 

The invasion of New Britain was the climax of the drive 
up the Solomons-New Guinea ladder, for at the eastern end 
of this island was Rabaul, chief enemy base in the South- 
west Pacific. While Army and Navy bombers pounded Ra- 
baul in daily raids, the approach overland was made by land- 
ings about 280 miles west, first at Arawe and then at Cape 

235 



Gloucester, giving American forces contol of western New 
Britain [December 15, 1943]. 

The invasion of Arawe by units of the U. S. Sixth Army 
was preceded by a bombardment of 350 tons of bombs, and 
within five days after their landing the Americans cleared 
the enemy out of Arawe Peninsula. The 1st Marine Division 
under Major General William H. Rupertus, veterans of 
Guadalcanal, landed at points east and west of Cape Glou- 
cester [December 26, 1943], after Allied bombers prepared 
the way with thirteen hundred tons of high explosives, and 
squeezed the enemy out of the Cape in four days. The Ma- 
rines drove east to Borgen Bay, captured Hill 660 [January 
14, 1944] in a battle lasting ten days, and joined the infan- 
try driving inland from Arawe to complete the conquest of 
western New Britain [February 24, 1944]. Marines jumped 
up the northern coast by landing at Talasea [March 6, 
1944] , 110 miles above Cape Gloucester, and drove eastward 
on Rabaul to Cape Hoskins. 

Amphibious hops across the islands of the Admiralty and 
St. Matthias groups, the northern ring of the Bismarck Sea, 
finished the neutralization of Rabaul by cutting it off from 
Truk, eight hundred miles north, the main Japanese base in 
the Central Pacific and connecting link with the Southwest 
Pacific. The first landing in the Admiralty group [February 
29, 1944] was made by elements of the U. S. 1st Cavalry 
Division, dismounted, at Los Negros Island. With the cap- 
ture of Larengau on Manus Island [March 18, 1944] the 
Admiralty group fell into American hands. Air strips on 
these islands endangered the supply line of some fifty thou- 
sand Japanese stranded in Rabaul and New Britain. 

II. NAVAL SUPERIORITY 

Backing up the American advance in the Pacific, and the 
landings in North Africa, Sicily, and Italy, was the strength 
of the United States Navy, without which the Army could 
never have crossed the Atlantic and Pacific to engage the 
enemy. It was not enough for the Navy to be able to defeat 
the Japanese battle fleet and German submarines; in the 
Pacific our naval forces had also to mount amphibious at- 
tacks, sweep the enemy from the skies, and conquer the 

236 



island defenses of the Japanese Empire. We needed the 
strongest navy in the world to defeat the Japanese fleet. 
While we knew it ranked third at the outbreak of hostilities, 
we had to reckon with new ships built in secret and the dis- 
tant bases won by amphibious blitzkrieg. To overwhelm 
Japan, therefore, the United States needed one fleet, the 
largest, in the Pacific; we needed other fleets just as large to 
patrol the seaways which led to American troops and bases 
scattered all over the world. 

To meet its world-wide responsibilities, the United States 
Navy became the strongest in the world. In three years, from 
1940 to 1943, it developed the greatest power ever seen in 
combination on the sea and in the air. American naval 
strength increased from 1,076 to 4,167 ships, besides 80,000 
landing craft, and from 383 to 613 warships. Planes multi- 
plied from 1,744 to 18,269, and in 1944 approached a total 
of 37,000 for the Navy alone. One fleet grew into several, and 
in addition developed a large air force. The personnel re- 
quired to man these ships and planes, with all their shore 
stations, expanded in the two years between Pearl Habor 
and 1944 from less than half a million officers and men, in- 
cluding the Marine Corps and Coast Guard, to three million. 
By the middle of 1944 it was estimated that American naval 
strength was many times that of Japan and three times that 
of Great Britain. 

These increases were all the more remarkable because 
they continued despite the losses inevitable in war. Up to 
the last quarter of 1943 enough ships were sunk or trans- 
ferred to other uses to make up a small navy of half a million 
tons. Fifty-nine warships were lost: two battleships, four 
large aircraft carriers, nine cruisers, thirty-two destroyers, 
and twelve submarines. In addition, one hundred twenty-nine 
warships were assigned to other nations or converted to non- 
combat duty. These losses were small compared to what 
Japan lost during the first year after Pearl Harbor: two bat- 
tleships, seven carriers (five of them the largest in the world), 
three cruisers, and a considerable number of destroyers and 
submarines which could only be guessed at. Thus the Ameri- 
can Navy became superior to the Japanese in 1943, chiefly 
by new construction, and with this superiority was able to 

237 



take the offensive and destroy the enemy forces in combat. 

Not only did the United States become the mightiest sea 
and air power in the world, but its program of construction 
exceeded all other nations in speed as well as in size. The 
Government collaborated with industry in expanding ship- 
yards and building new ones. The time required for com- 
pleting a ship from laying the keel to launching it was pro- 
gressively diminished. Before Pearl Harbor an aircraft car- 
rier took nearly three years to build, but in 1943 little more 
than one year. Destroyers whose construction formerly re- 
quired over a year were turned out in less than half a year. 
This gain was the work of management and labor in the 
shipyards, where the number of men and women who built 
and repaired naval vessels increased from less than half a 
million to over a million between Pearl Harbor and July 
1943. These men and women in overalls gave the men in 
uniform the ships and arms to fight at sea. Their achieve- 
ment is illustrated by the fact that they delivered five ves- 
sels to the Navy in June 1940; two years later, in a single 
month, they produced twelve hundred vessels. 

Priority went to different classes of ships at different times 
according to changes in our strategic needs. The crises of 
the war at sea are reflected in the order of preferred vessels, 
from battleships to aircraft carriers and baby flat-tops in 
1942, to destroyer escorts and cruisers in 1943, and to land- 
ing craft in 1944. When five of the eight old battleships at 
Pearl Harbor were sunk or disabled, only two of ten new 
battleships, the North Carolina and Washington, were in serv- 
ice. Immediate priority was given to other capital ships with 
the result that in the next two years seven more were 
launched, the South Dakota of 35,000 tons, the Indiana, 
Massachusetts, and Alabama and the largest battleships of 
52,000 tons, the Iowa, New Jersey, and Missouri. Three more 
of these giants, the Wisconsin, Illinois, and Kentucky, were 
soon to join the others, giving the Navy a total of twenty-five 
battleships. 

When four of the seven aircraft carriers with which we 
entered the war were lost in the Pacific, leaving only the 
Saratoga, Enterprise, and Ranger afloat in the fall of 1942, 
the construction of carriers was speeded up. Twenty big car- 

238 



riers, of the 27,000-ton Essex class, were finished in 1943; 
nine light cruisers were converted into 10,000-ton carriers 
of the Independence class; and other carriers, the 10,000-ton 
Breton and 9,000-ton Casablanca classes, were built. By the 
end of 1943 more than fifty aircraft carriers joined the forces 
in the Pacific. Their completion months ahead of schedule 
enabled the Navy to advance its timetable of operations 
and launch an offensive which resulted in the conquest of 
the Gilbert, Marshall, Caroline, and Marianas Islands long 
before it was thought possible to deliver such crippling blows 
to Japan. 

The most significant accomplishment in building carriers 
during 1942 was the production of the baby fiat-tops which 
drove the German U-boats to cover in the Atlantic. The 
first escort carrier was the Long Island, converted early in 
1941 from a merchant ship and commissioned in 1942. The 
success of this improvisation promised all convoys the air 
cover necessary to win the Battle of the Atlantic. C-3 (cargo) 
hulls and oilers were quickly transformed into small combat 
carriers. Besides serving as anti-submarine escorts for our 
supply lines, they were used to deliver planes to distant shores 
where and when they were sorely needed, and they also 
added their air strength to the striking force of the larger 
carriers. 

The Navy did not limit its expansion to ships. It devel- 
oped its own air arm with land-based as well as carrier- 
based planes. The world's largest flying boat, the Martin 
Mars, entered service in 1944 on the seventy thousand miles 
of scheduled flights operated by the Naval Air Transport 
Service. The Grumman Wildcat fighter was followed by the 
Hellcat and the Chance- Vought Corsair, superior in speed, 
armor, and fire power to any Japanese planes. The Douglas 
Dauntless, a dive bomber which worked great destruction in 
the Pacific, was improved on by the Curtiss Helldiver. The 
Grumman Avenger, a versatile torpedo bomber which first 
went into action at the Battle of Midway, became the main- 
stay of the aerial attack in the Pacific. 

The United States Pacific Fleet was so heavily reinforced 
early in 1943 that it could be divided into task fleets, and 
these fleets into task forces, each like a military combat 

239 



team with variable strength adapted to special missions. Ad- 
miral Chester W. Nimitz remained in command of all naval 
forces in the Pacific, but delegated several task fleets to oper- 
ations in different parts of these waters. Early in 1944, Ad- 
miral William F. Halsey, Jr., commanded the Third Fleet, 
and Admiral Raymond A. Spruance the Fifth Fleet. These 
were the same fleet at different times, operating in the Pa- 
cific, all ships identical. In the Southwest Pacific was the 
Seventh Fleet under Vice Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid, and 
around the Aleutians the Ninth Fleet under Vice Admiral 
Frank J. Fletcher. 

In other waters, too, there were American fleets in 1944. 
Two patrolled the Atlantic: the Fourth in the South Atlantic 
under Vice Admiral (now Admiral) Jonas H. Ingram, and 
the Tenth in the North under Vice Admiral Royal E. Inger- 
soll. The Twelfth Fleet sailed European waters with Admiral 
Harold R. Stark; the Eighth was in the Mediterranean with 
Vice Admiral Henry K. Hewitt. The naval power of the 
United States circled the world. 

The construction and assignment of new aircraft carriers 
to the Pacific gave the Navy command of the air against 
Japan in 1944. Altogether there were nearly one hundred 
carriers, large and small, with over one thousand planes, in 
the Pacific task forces. Most of them operated under Vice 
Admiral Marc A. Mitscher as Task Force 58 (or 38, depend- 
ing on whether Halsey or Spruance was in command) 
screened by battleships, cruisers, and destroyers, with the 
whole Pacific for their hunting ground. Overwhelming naval 
superiority such as this threatened not only the Japanese 
Navy, if it could be brought to battle, but Japan itself. 

III. THE CENTRAL PACIFIC 

With increasing naval and air-power, the American forces 
in the Central Pacific launched a drive to reach the coast of 
China and win island bases for air fleets to strike directly at 
Japan. The offensive began with an invasion of the outer 
defenses of the Japanese Empire in the far-flung Gilbert, 
Marshall, Caroline, and Marianas Islands. All forces com- 
bined their strength in operations by land, sea, and air, the 

240 



scale of which had never before been witnessed in the world's 
history. 

Makin and Tarawa: Operation Galvanic 

The first islands to be conquered were Makin and Tarawa 
in the Gilberts 2,500 miles southwest of Pearl Harbor. On 
November 20-24, while the Tarawa garrison was under Ma- 
rine attack, the 27th Infantry Division Task Force under 
Major General Ralph C. Smith overwhelmed a small garri- 
son of three hundred Japanese infantry in stout defenses on 
Makin, enemy seaplane base a hundred miles north of 
Tarawa. The American casualties were 253. Two battalions 
of the 165th Infantry, the New York "Fighting Irish," with 
all their artillery and some tanks, established themselves 
nearly two miles west of the strongly held area, providing 
fire support for the later attack of the remaining battalion. 
Pillboxes were cleaned out in two days and the enemy, dis- 
organized from the start and fortified with sake, dissipated 
their remaining strength in a suicidal night counterattack. 
A single battalion mopped up. Apamama Island was also 
occupied by the 27th Division. 

Tarawa was a different story. It was conquered only by 
the unflinching bravery of our soldiers in one of the bloodiest 
assaults in American history. The coral island of Betio in 
the Tarawa Atoll, three miles long and one mile wide, was 
defended by three thousand Japanese Imperial Marines. 
Concrete bunkers impervious to naval and aerial fire had 
been prepared there by fifteen hundred labor troops. The 
blockhouses had outer walls ten feet thick of sand and coral 
and were roofed with iron rails laid on palm logs more than 
a foot in diameter, all of which protected concrete emplace- 
ments five feet thick. These amazing forts could not be shat- 
tered even by the one thousand tons of bombs which the 
Seventh Air Force rained down. They had to be taken by 
direct infantry assault with grenades, flamethrowers, and 
bangalore torpedoes hurled through the eye slits and gun- 
ports. At both ends of the island, moreover, were batteries 
of six-inch and eight-inch guns brought from Singapore. 
Never before had a little tropical island been converted into 
such a mighty fortress. 

241 



The attack began with a night bombardment by naval 
vessels and carrier planes which covered the island with 
smoke and flame. When it seemed as if no human being 
could be left alive in this inferno, the 2d Marine Division 
under Major General Julian C. Smith stormed ashore [No- 
vember 21, 1943]. The first three waves landed at high tide 
and gripped the beach under intense machine-gun fire from 
enemy bunkers. Three beachheads 150 feet deep were se- 
cured. The fourth and fifth waves grounded five hundred 
yards off shore on reefs exposed by high wind and a falling 
tide. Marines jumped into water up to their necks and waded 
ashore, suffering severe losses from a rain of machine-gun 
bullets. 

That night in bright moonlight, while the beach parties 
barely held their ground against snipers, we landed tanks 
and reinforcements. At dawn the enemy flanked the Marines 
on a nearby beach and caught them in an enfilade fire. 
Cruisers, destroyers, and dive bombers rooted the Japanese 
out. Then began the systematic reduction of enemy pillboxes 
with TNT charges, flamethrowers, and torpedoes. By noon 
of the next day the Japanese were confined to the western 
end of the island, and that night they made a suicide charge. 
The last snipers were killed on the fourth day of the assault. 
Tarawa had cost the Marines 913 killed and missing, and 
2,037 wounded. 

Kwajalein: Operation Flintlock 

The next American blow in the Central Pacific fell north- 
west of the Gilberts on the Marshall Islands, which extend 
over six himdred miles of water and screen the island of 
Truk, key Japanese naval base. The invading force by-passed 
the strong eastern garrisons at Jaluit and Wotje, and sprang 
a tactical surprise on the enemy northwest at Kwajalein. 
This atoll is 2,415 miles southwest of Pearl Harbor and 1,046 
miles east of Truk. It is formed by low sandy islands which 
enclose a lagoon eighty miles long. The chief islands are 
Kwajalein, Roi, and Namur, among which the enemy divided 
a force of about eight thousand men to guard his airfields. 
Heavy bombing crippled these airfields before the invasion 
[January 21-29, 1944] and on the eve of attack a great 

242 



naval task force under Vice Admiral Richmond K. Turner 
shelled and bombed the Kwajalein atoll for two days and 
nights with 14,500 tons of high explosives [January 30-Feb- 
ruary 1, 1944] . The fire preparation was more thorough than 
at Tarawa ; it cut Kwajalein up into a maze of craters. 

The 7th Infantry Division, commanded by Major Gen- 
eral Charles H. Corlett, landed on undefended islands which 
outflanked Kwajalein, emplaced artillery, and next day 
landed on Kwajalein itself with tanks [February 1, 1944]. 
It was occupied yard by yard with the aid of air and naval 
fire and additional flank landings [February 3-6, 1944]. 
The same tactics carried out by the 4th Marine Division 
under Major General Harry Schmidt took Roi and Namur 
[February 1-3, 1944]. Concrete pillboxes were reduced by 
bazookas and flamethrowers. Throughout this operation, 
which was essentially a mopping-up job, naval and air forces 
covered the troops with concentrated fire. Total American 
casualties were 1,516, of whom 286 were killed, while the 
enemy lost 8,122 killed and 264 captured. From Kwajalein 
a naval task force carried the 2 2d Marine and 106th In- 
fantry Regiments 340 miles west to capture the enemy air 
base of Engebi [February 17-19, 1944] in the Eniwetok 
Atoll with casualties of five hundred. 

So overwhelming was American air and sea power that the 
naval task force, with several battleships and aircraft car- 
riers, proceeded east into the heart of enemy waters. Hun- 
dreds of planes attacked the great Japanese base at Truk and 
destroyed 201 planes and 23 ships with a loss of only 17 
planes [February 16, 1944]. Although this daring raid did 
not catch the Japanese fleet, which had deserted Truk, it 
upset the Nipponese so much that Premier Tojo took over 
the duties of Army Chief of Staff himself, while the Navy 
Minister, Admiral Shimada, was made Navy Chief of Staff 
[February 21, 1944]. The U. S. fleet, continuing its sweep 
westward next struck at the enemy base of Saipan [February 
21, 1944] in the Marianas Islands, fifteen hundred miles 
south of Tokyo. Here 135 Japanese planes were destroyed, 
one ship was sunk, and ten others damaged. The American 
Navy sailed with impunity through waters over three thou- 
sand miles west of Pearl Harbor. Enemy bases in the Mar- 

243 



shall and Carolines, outer perimeter of the Pacific defense 
of the Japanese Empire, were either captured as at Kwaja- 
lein, left to starve as at Jaluit, or rendered useless as at Truk. 
This daring American victory proved that the offensive in 
the Central Pacific was under way. 

IV. BURMA: OPERATION CAPITAL 

It was nearly two years after the fall of Burma before 
Allied forces could undertake a major offensive to pry loose 
the Japanese grip on the northern country into which the 
Ledo Road was being built for the supply of China. This 
long delay was due to the weakness of the Allies in CBI and 
the slow rate at which supplies were accumulated in moun- 
tain jungles halfway around the world. Ground operations 
here were limited from May to October by the monsoon, and 
throughout the year by the relative lack of supply. Hence 
the Allies first took the offensive in Burma with small forces 
of airborne troops. 

Airborne Invasion 

British airborne infantry organized by Major General 
Orde C. Wingate first invaded the jungles of northern Burma 
in March 1943 and operated for several weeks behind enemy 
lines. They were supplied entirely by air as they struck at 
Japanese communications without ever being caught by the 
enemy in force. The success of Wingate 's Raiders in disor- 
ganizing the Japanese' rear [^M^M5^ 11-24, 1943] inspired 
the Allied leaders at the Quebec Conference to develop this 
method of penetrating Burma. 

General Arnold ordered Colonel Philip G. Cochran and 
Lieutenant Colonel (now Colonel) John R. Alison to or- 
ganize and train the First Air Commando Force of the 
United States Army Air Forces. They chose their glider pilots 
from volunteers, insisted that every airplane pilot should also 
be his own mechanic, and in December 1943 transferred their 
limited force secretely to India, where two bases on opposite 
sides of the country were turned over by the Royal Air 
Force, one for gliders, another for light planes. There the 
force was organized in several sections, to fly B-25 Mitchell 
bombers, P-51 Mustang fighters, lightplanes, gliders, C-47 

244 



Skytrain transports, and UC-64 supply planes. To the orig- 
inal personnel were added a photographic reconnaissance 
detachment and a company of engineers. Tactically the 
whole force was to act in support of other units, especially 
of Wingate's Indian Raiders and Merrill's Marauders, carv- 
ing air strips out of the jungle, flying planes from them, and 
bringing in supplies and reinforcements. Strategically their 
operations were designed to weaken the Japanese rear in the 
Chin Hills and northern Burma. 

Two landing sites were picked in this region 160 miles be- 
hind enemy lines and dubbed "Piccadilly" and "Broadway" 
in token of their British and American visitors. The invasion 
began at night when twenty-six transport planes with thirty- 
seven gliders in tow landed more than five hundred men in 
the Broadway jungle [March 5, 1944]. All thought of using 
Piccadilly was abandoned when photographic reconnaissance 
showed at the last minute that it had been mined by the 
enemy. Engineers improved Broadway and prepared another 
jungle strip, Chowringhee, and to these fields in the next 
six nights were brought thousands of men, 250 tons of sup- 
plies, bulldozers, and 1,183 Missouri mules. When the enemy 
discovered and attacked Broadway a week later, he was 
repulsed by airborne reinforcements. General Wingate was 
killed in a plane crash [March 13, 1944], and his command 
passed to Major General W. D. A. Lentaigne [March 25, 
1944]. Through the spring of 1944 these airborne troops in 
the Burmese jungles — Merrill's Marauders and Wingate's 
Raiders — lived up to their names in supporting larger opera- 
tions by British and American ground troops on the thou- 
sand mile front between India and Burma. 

Arakan Campaign 

At the southern end of this front the Japanese forces cov- 
ering the forward port of Akyab launched a tactical offensive 
[February 4, 1944], while still on the strategic defense, 
against British troops assembling for a drive south. The 
Japanese penetrated the Mayu Mountains and enveloped 
the British 7th Indian Division [February 7-20, 1944], 
which maintained a hedgehog defense until the 5th Indians 
Division succeeded in opening communications with it by 

245 



pushing south on both sides of the Mayu range and captur- 
ing Kyauktaw [February 25, 1944]. The British attack was 
renewed with tanks and artillery, despite the hilly jungle 
swamps, and carried as far as Buthedaung. [April 6, 1944], 
As the enemy counterattacked above the Kaladan Valley, 
Buthedaung was evacuated [May 6, 1944]. The Japanese 
and British then transferred the contest northwards to the 
Manipur front. The 5th Indian Division, with all its moun- 
tain batteries and mules, was moved to this sector in sixty 
hours by American transport planes of Brigadier General 
William D. Old's Troop Carrier Command. 

Manipur Campaign 

After preparations which consumed the winter of 1943-44, 
the Japanese made their main strike in Burma at the center 
of the Allied front, in the Manipur sector [March 13, 1944], 
in an effort to cut the Assam- Bengal railroad. This railroad, 
running parallel to the Burmese border about one hundred 
miles west of the frontier, was the supply line of Chinese- 
American forces along the Ledo Road in northern Burma. 
It gave strategic importance to little Manipur, a native state 
in India about the size of New Jersey, with a village capital 
at Imphal. 

Three Japanese divisions converged upon Imphal and cut 
off the British 17th Indian Division of British IV Corps, 
covering the southern approach at Tiddim [March 30, 1944] . 
This division broke through the enemy lines and retired 
northward to support the 23d, also of IV Corps, which was 
hard pressed by another Japanese column cutting the high- 
way from Tiddim to Imphal at Bishenpur. The defense of 
this area was crucial, because it was the eastern end of a 
supply trail to Silchar on the Bengal-Assam railroad. Sixty 
miles north the railroad itself was threatened by an enemy 
force surrounding Kohima. 

When another Japanese column penetrated the hills to 
within twenty-five miles of Imphal, the British awoke to 
the fact that these enemy columns, which had been mis- 
taken for patrols, were actually enclosing Imphal on three 
sides in force. A cordon defense of the Imphal Plain was im- 
provised by the 17th and 23d Divisions. Counterattacks 

246 



northeast pushed the Japanese back toward Ukhrul [April 
20, 1944], undoing their advance of a month past ; and troops 
to the south around Bishenpur stopped the enemy at a 
narrow mountain pass. The British III Corps, defending the 
railroad farther north at Dimapur, reinforced by the 5th 
Division from the Arakan sector, punched a hole in the enemy 
lines around Kohima and temporarily relieved the encircled 
garrison. [April 19, 1944]. But in the month that remained 
before the monsoon started late in May, the British were 
unable to raise the siege of Imphal, and supplies were brought 
in by air as the Japanese closed the road west to Silchar. 

Around Kohima, farther north, the III Corps drove the 
enemy back upon the town and secured the Bengal-Assam 
railroad with communications to the junction at Dimapur 
[April 25-28, 1944]. The Japanese dug into the town of 
Kohima and made it the "Cassino" of Burma [May 11-15, 
1944] . Here they were worn down by constant assault. After 
two months of bitter fighting, which went on during the 
monsoon, Anglo-Indian troops recaptured Kohima and raised 
the siege of the Imphal Plain [June 30, 1944]. It was esti- 
mated that thirteen thousand Japanese were killed in this 
campaign. The fighting in Manipur had a character all its 
own, combining mountain and jungle warfare, and could be 
compared only to New Guinea. 

Ledo Road Campaign 

The most successful campaiign in Burma during the spring 
of 1944 was fought in the north by Chinese and American 
troops under General Stilwell. To cover the construction of 
the Ledo Road, as it was extended southward into enemy 
country, a Chinese corps of two divisions, trained in India 
by Americans and equipped on Lend-Lease, pushed up the 
Hukawng Valley and captured Taihpa Ga [February 1, 
1944]. American troops, under Brigadier General (now 
Major General) Frank Merrill, on one side of the valley and 
Chinese on the other caught the Japanese between them and 
pushed them back through Maingkwan and Walawbum with 
enemy losses of four thousand men [March 4, 1944] . In their 
advance up the Hukawng Valley the Chinese and American 
forces penetrated the jungle about a mile a day for forty 

247 



miles. Their progress seemed slow, but it was rapid enough 
to prevent the building of the Ledo Road from keeping pace 
with it. 

The Allies moved southward into the Mogaung Valley 
and pushed the Japanese back toward the old Burma Road. 
Their objective was Myitkyina, chief enemy air base and 
railhead of the only line in Burma. Three columns, composed 
of Chinese and Indian troops with American reinforcements, 
advanced up parallel valleys against the Japanese 18th Di- 
vision, victors at Singapore, supported by 150mm. artillery 
who stood their ground doggedly. In the enemy rear Win- 
gate's Raiders, roving in small parties and avoiding pitched 
battles, destroyed the supply dumps south of Mogaung. 

When the Chinese advance was slowed down after reach- 
ing Wakaung [April 5, 1944], Merrill's Marauders moved 
secretly across country in three columns, keeping liaison by 
radio, being supplied by air, and advancing along jungle 
trails about five miles a day [April 27, 1944]. They crossed 
a mountain range eight thousand feet high and seized the 
Myitkyina airfield [May 17, 1944], where glider-borne Chi- 
nese and American engineers were landed. An attack was 
launched against Myitkyina from the rear [May 19, 1944], 
as the Chinese pressed slowly forward in front through the 
Mogaung Valley. In July, Mogaung and then Myitkyina 
fell under the pressure of these converging forces. 

The next objective was Bhamo, farther south, where the 
road from Ledo, 250 miles away, was to connect with the 
old Burma Road. While the Chinese were engaged in the 
reduction of Myitkyina, another corps of the Chinese Twen- 
tieth Army Group opened a drive eighty miles to the east 
along the Salween River, supported by the U.S. Fourteenth 
Air Force [May 10-15, 1944]. They crossed the Salween, 
bypassed a Japanese division, and threatened to advance 
astride the Burma Road to Bhamo. In the mountains their 
progress was slow because small Japanese machine-gun nests 
commanding the passes could hold up whole divisions. 

Allied military operations in Burma, to sum up, assured 
the completion of the Ledo Road and promised to increase 
supply to China with the liberation of the Burma Road. 
Chungking still depended on India but looked forward to 

248 



Burma as its main base. Whether Burma could be recon- 
quered before the American forces in the Central Pacific 
reached the South China coast was a question for the future 
to answer. 



2^. RESTORATION OF THE SOVIET UNION 

The great Soviet offensive which started rolling on the 
Kursk-Orel front in the summer of 1943 did not stop until 
the following spring when the Nazi invaders were driven 
completely out of southern Russia. The success of this offen- 
sive was due primarily to Russian arms, but they received 
powerful assistance from the United States and Great Britain. 

British and American Aid 

Most helpful was the tremendous quantity of American 
Lend-Lease supplies which reached Russia during 1943. 
Shipments were doubled over 1942 and losses in transit from 
enemy bombers and U-boats fell from twelve to one per cent. 
From October 1941 to January 1944, a total of 7,800 planes, 
of which 3,000 flew all the way, 4,700 tanks and tank de- 
stroyers, 170,000 trucks, six million pairs of military boots, 
over 200,000 field telephones and 700,000 miles of telephone 
wire, 177,00 tons of explosives, 740,000 tons of aviation 
gasoline, 1,350,000 tons of steel, and 2,250,000 tons of food 
were exported from the United States to the Soviet Union. 
Russia also received a few entire industrial plants removed 
from American factories and put to work in the Soviet Union, 
such as the equipment for an oil refinery and all the ma- 
chinery for a tire factory, capable of turning out a million 
truck tires a year. The total value of all these Lend-Lease 
supplies amounted to about four and a quarter billion dol- 
lars. When added to the much larger production of the Soviet 
Union for its own forces, Lend-Lease materiel gave the Red 
armies greater mobility, better communications, and for the 
first time during the war, command of the air. 

The United States and Great Britain contributed to Rus- 
sian success not only in supply but also in actual combat. 
When their offensive in the Mediterranean drove Italy out 

249 



of the war, Germany took five to twenty divisions from the 
Russian front to replace Italian troops who had surrendered 
and to build up the defensive forces in Western Europe. The 
majority of German troops who stepped into the breach left 
by the Italians came from Occupied France. Their places in 
turn were filled by reserves from Germany, and thus the 
Nazis had fewer reserves at home to reinforce the Russian 
front, where manpower was at a premium. 

Even more helpful to the Russians than this tapping of 
German manpower was the great aerial offensive of British 
and American bombers in 1943 and 1944. It sapped Nazi 
morale and reduced the capacity of German industries try- 
ing to supply both the Russian and Italian fronts. Above all, 
by drawing the bulk of Nazi fighter planes from east to west, 
the bombers from Britain gave the Red air forces command 
of the air in Russia. 

Railroad Strategy of the Red Offensive 

Red ground troops, with close tactical air support, en- 
gaged by far the larger part of the German armies. To drive 
the Nazis out of the Soviet Union the Russians struck at 
railroads and strongpoints on their main lines of resistance. 
The two generally coincided. From north to south the strong- 
points of Staraya Russa, Vitebsk, Mogilev, Zhlobin, Koros- 
ten, Zhitomir, Kiev, Smela, Krivoi Rog, and Nikolaev were 
all railway junctions. While the public watched the war in 
Russia to see who won and lost the great cities, Moscow, 
Leningrad, Kharkov, Kiev, and Odessa, or the great rivers, 
the Don, Donets, Dnieper, Bug and Dniester the high com- 
mands of both armies fought for railroads. These lines were 
necessary for supply and communications over the vast dis- 
tances of Russia, and the lateral connections between them, 
running north and south, were vital to the quick transfer of 
reserves for attack or. defense on a threatened front. 

The network of Russian railroads was therefore the skele- 
ton of every campaign. The northern or Leningrad front of 
the Germans was fed by the railroad from Warsaw through 
Vilna, Dvinsk, Ostrov, and Luga to Leningrad. Another line 
from Warsaw led to the central Moscow front through Minsk, 
Orsha, and Smolensk, with a southern branch through Gomel 

250 



and Bryansk to Kaluga. The southern front was divided into 
two sectors, the upper Don and Dnieper, and the lower 
bends of these long rivers. The first depended on the rail- 
road from Warsaw through Lublin, Kowel, Sarny, and Kiev 
to Konotop and Kursk; the second upon southern branches 
from Kowel and Kiev to Smela, Dniepropetrovsk, and the 
Crimea, and upon a trunk line from Berlin to Breslau, Kra- 
kow, Lwow, Tarnopol, Zhmerinka, and Odessa. The Russian 
summer offensive in 1943 robbed the enemy of many lateral 
rail connections north and south, and the winter offensive in 
1944 cut the great trunk lines from Germany and Poland into 
southern Russia. 

Retreat Beyond the Dnieper 

The Russian offensive moved swiftly and stabbed at one 
front and another with a speed and weight calculated to 
bleed Nazi manpower into rapid exhaustion. The cost of de- 
fense to the enemy was high — perhaps 200,000 casualties in 
each of the worst months. No Nazi armies were lost as at 
Stalingrad, and none were encircled except at Korsun. Yet 
the power of the Russian drives may be judged from the 
estimate that 320 divisions were massed against the 250 
Axis divisions struggling to retain their conquests. 

The Germans had resolved, in a high command confer- 
ence during the summer of 1943, to withdraw only as far as 
the Dnieper River. But the relentless Russian drives made 
them retreat from the Dnieper across the Dniester in south- 
ern Russia, back into Poland on the central front, and al- 
most to the Baltic states below Leningrad. It was not a 
strategic withdrawal, nor was it voluntary. The Nazis wasted 
forces, exhausted reserves, lost vital railway arteries, and in 
the south, where the fighting was heaviest, never succeeded 
in maintaining a defensive line of prepared positions. There 
was no rout of the German armies; they retreated in good 
order. Nevertheless it was always retreat, and no counterof- 
fensives lasted beyond six weeks or permanently regained 
any Russian soil. 

Central Front 

The central front was least active in the Russian winter 

251 



offensive of 1943 -44 ^ but sprang to life in the following sum- 
mer, when the Red armies first drove in its flanks at the ex- 
treme north and south. After these sectors were cleared, it 
became strategically possible to take the enemy in the center 
on either side of the Pripet Marshes. In preparation for the 
summer drives to come. General Rokossovsky captured the 
rail junction of Mozry on the lateral line from Nevel to 
Korosten and drove forward to positions north of the Pripet 
Marshes, threatening Zhlobin and Mogilev [January 12, 
1944]. Farther north, Siberian soldiers of the First Baltic 
Army, led by Cossack and ski troops, outflanked the Nazi 
strongpoint of Vitebsk and cut off its rail supply in the rear 
[January 2, 1944]. The Germans maintained their central 
front intact through the winter, though under constant pres- 
sure, and Russian forces were shifted north and south for 
the principal drives in those sectors. 

Relief of Leningrad 

Leningrad, besieged by German and Finnish troops for 
two and a half years, survived an ordeal of intermittent shell- 
ing by 12- and 16-inch guns which shattered public buildings, 
wounded fifteen thousand people, and killed five thousand. 
Private dwellings had no water, no heat, no electric light. 
The scarcity of food was worse than daily bombardment, for 
malnutrition caused more deaths than shells or bombs. The 
civilians of Leningrad fought, like those of London, by never 
stopping their daily work. 

The siege was raised in the winter of 1944 by an offensive 
which drove the Germans southward to a line between Pskov 
and. Lake Ilmen [January 15, 1944]. Heavy artillery blasted 
the fortified German lines [February 20, 1944] with two 
and a half million shells in four days. Two Red armies, re- 
ported to have an overwhelming strength of forty infantry 
and twenty armored divisions, went into action on a front 
of sixty-six miles against an enemy force estimated at twen- 
ty-three infantry and four tank divisions. 

The advance was slow, averaging four miles a day at the 
start, for Nazi rear guards fought stubbornly at every vil- 
lage, mined the swamps, cut roadblocks out of the forest, and 
defended them with combat teams of tanks and armored in- 

252 



fantry. A mild winter made it impossible for the Russians 
to cross the swamps, and infantry dragged the artillery along. 
Soviet guerrillas worked havoc in the enemy rear and derailed 
or blew up thirty-seven Nazi supply trains. As the Russians 
advanced, they captured 150 of the 12 -inch guns with which 
the Nazis had bombarded Leningrad. 

There were two offensives, one southward from Leningrad, 
another westward from the Volkhov River. The latter drive 
outflanked Novgorod and the former cleared the railroad to 
Moscow [January 20, 1944]. These two drives joined in a 
front northwest of Chudovo to trap the Nazis retreating 
toward Estonia [February 1, 1944]. Luga fell to Red ski 
troops [February 13, 1944]. Staraya Russa, chief Nazi 
strongpoint in the north, was encircled and captured [Feb- 
ruary 17, 1944]. The Germans withdrew on a front of three 
hundred miles to a line running from the Gulf of Finland 
south to Pskov, east to Lake Ilmen, and halfway south to 
Velikie Luki [February 21, 1944]. Moscow claimed that the 
enemy lost ninety thousand men in this retreat. Leningrad 
breathed again, its vital war factories resumed production, 
and the Russian command began preparations for the break- 
through which was to reclaim the Baltic states in the summer. 

Fanning Out from Kiev 

Most of the fighting in Russia during the winter of 1943- 
44 took place in the south, where the Dnieper Bend and the 
Ukraine were entirely reclaimed. The Nazi invaders were 
driven out of the USSR and back upon the borders of Po- 
land and Rumania. For six weeks at the end of 1943, how- 
ever, the German army around Kiev counterattacked in force 
and reconquered much territory. The Red Army had recov- 
ered these losses ten days after launching its winter offensive 
in this area. 

In a spectacular breakthrough on a front of 185 miles, the 
First Ukrainian Army commanded by Marshal Vatutin drove 
west of Kiev [December 29, 1943\, sweeping twenty-two 
Nazi divisions before it, captured the rail junctions of Kor- 
osten and Zhitomir, eighty miles beyond, and advanced to 
the old Polish border, along the railroad running from Kiev 
to Warsaw. This line was cut at Sarny and the enemy was 

253 



thrown back against the Pripet Marshes [January 12, 1944], 
v/hich divided his forces and broke the continuity of his 
front. The left flank of Vatutin's forces thrust southward 
toward Zhmerinka, junction of the Lwow-Odessa railroad, 
the only trunk line left to the Nazis in southern Russia. The 
Russians knew that if it fell, the German armies far to the 
east in the Dnieper Bend might be trapped. In February, 
however, heavy Nazi counterattacks in support of Zhmerinka 
stopped the Red Army on this front for over a month. 

Encirclement at Korsun 

As the Germans withdrew westward on the strategic de- 
fensive, they often assumed a tactical offensive to slow up 
the Russian advance. Southwest of Kiev, for example, fifteen 
Nazi divisions pushed back toward the city as far as Zhaskov 
in an effort to stem the Russian thrust to Zhmerinka and 
protect the forces in the Dnieper Bend [January 11-30, 
1944]. Against this counteroffensive two Red armies under- 
took one of the most complicated operations of the war and 
demonstrated their superiority in the strategy of maneuver — 
secret of the rapid Russian advances. 

The First and Second Ukrainian Armies, commanded by 
Vatutin and Konev, encircled the German Eighth Army 
which held the upper Dnieper on a front of fifty miles above 
Cherkassy and east of Korsun. Each Russian army, consist- 
ing of twelve to fifteen motorized divisions, converged on 
the other [January 24-February 3, 1944] and advanced 
about fifty miles in four days through the enemy rear to 
complete the circle. They caught the Germans by surprise 
because they had opened their maneuvers with tactical feints 
away from the Eighth Army. 

The operation was complicated by the necessity of cutting 
off and containing not only the encircled Eighth Army but 
also Manstein's forces advancing northeast on Kiev. Vatutin 
rendered the latter powerless by swinging his troops west- 
ward to stand back to back against the troops of Konev, 
and face the Germans. As soon as Manstein discovered the 
trap, he supplied the encircled Eighth Army by air and 
hurled his forces east to break the circle [February 4-19, 
1944]. Rear echelons and service units escaped, among them 

254 



over two thousand wounded who were evacuated by plane, 
but the Red armies succeeded in destroying or capturing ten 
enemy divisions west of Korsun [February 17, 1944]. The 
Nazis lost 52,000 killed and 11,000 prisoners. This defeat 
broke the German grip on the upper Dnieper as Stalingrad 
had dislodged them from the Volga, and they retreated sixty 
miles across the Ukraine. 

Clearing the Dnieper Bend 

Three Soviet armies joined in powerful drives to clear the 
Dnieper Bend and liberate the Ukraine. The Third Ukrain- 
ian Army under General Malinovsky pried the Nazis loose 
from the lower Dnieper by breaking through their defenses 
[February 8, 1944] on a front of one hundred miles and cap- 
turing Nikopol, the city which produced one-fifth of the 
world's manganese. With Nikopol gone, the iron-ore city of 
Krivoi Rog to the northeast was open to attack. It surren- 
dered [February 22, 1944] to a concentric advance which 
the Germans failed to check when they committed their 
reserves too hastily on one flank. 

Farther south, above Nikolaev, a new German Sixth Army, 
recruited to replace the one lost at Stalingrad was routed 
by a hammer-and-sickle maneuver which exposed Nikolaev 
[March 6-16, 1944]. Nikolaev fell, together with Kherson 
on the lower Dnieper [March 13, 1944], to a pincers attack 
by infantry and tanks supported by Black Sea naval units. 
The Nazis withdrew [March 28, 1944] hastily southwest to 
the great port of Odessa, which was captured by assault 
[April 10, 1944] , after a brief siege, with Nazi losses reported 
at 26,000 killed and 11,000 prisoners. Most of the German 
forces had beaten their way out of the Dnieper Bend, but 
not without paying for their escape. 

Clearing the Ukraine 

Meanwhile, after sustaining Nazi counterattacks beyond 
Kiev, the First and Second Ukrainian Armies, commanded 
by Zhukov and Konev, resumed their offensives to drive the 
Germans out of the Ukraine. Konev's forces struck southwest 
toward Rumania, overwhelmed fourteen enemy divisions, 
captured their air bases at Uman, and crossed the middle 

255 



Bug [March 15, 1944]. They rolled on sixty miles to the 
Dniester [March 19, 1944], the old Rumanian border, forced 
a crossing at Mogilev into Bessarabia, and advanced to the 
Pruth [March 26, 1944]. The arrival of Russians at the 
Pruth marked their recovery for the first time of what Mar- 
shal Stalin hailed as the ''Soviet state frontier." In a year 
and a half they had come nine hundred miles from Stalingrad 
and reconquered all but sixty thousand square miles of their 
pre- 193 9 territory. 

Zhukov's First Ukrainian Army mounted an offensive on 
a front of one hundred miles west of Kiev and drove toward 
Poland. The offensive opened with the usual overpowering 
massed artillery barrages, which destroyed enemy batteries 
and strongpoints [March 7, 1944]. Zhukov's forces swept 
southwest forty miles in three days to cut the Lwow-Odessa 
railroad between Tarnopol and Proskurov [March 17-22, 
1944]. The rail junctions of Vinnitsa and Zhmerinka, key 
strongpoints of the western Ukraine, were captured [March 
30, 1944] and held against heavy enemy counterattacks. 
The advance continued southward to the rail junction of 
Cernauti, fifteen miles from the Tatar Pass through the Car- 
pathian Mountains into Hungary and Czechoslovakia. Mar- 
shal Zhukov claimed that in his swift advance he had routed 
twenty-four Axis divisions. As his forces entered old Poland 
and Rumania, the Ukraine was at last entirely free. [April 
2,1944]. 

Restoration of the Crimea 

The Nazis had retreated to the Dnieper but kept German 
and Rumanian troops in the Crimea hanging on the Russian 
flank and controlling the Black Sea. Cut off when Malinov- 
sky took Nikolaev, they were later destroyed by Soviet 
forces [March 28, 1944]. From the Kerch bridgehead two 
Red armies under Tolbukhin and Yeremenko fought their 
way westward for two weeks and finally swept forward forty 
miles in a day to isolate the Rumanian garrison at Sevastopol 
[April 15, 1944]. The demoralized enemy lost 37,000 pris- 
oners, it was reported, including one German and two Ru- 
manian divisions. 

Sevastopol, the naval fortress captured by the Nazis in 

256 



1942 after a siege of over six months, was liberated by the 
Russians [May 10, 1944] in one month. The fall of the base 
came three days after Tolbukhin's Fourth Ukrainian Army 
united with Yeremenko's Maritime Army and stormed the 
fortified defenses in the Yaila Mountains. The innermost belt 
of iron-and-concrete gun bastions was smashed by tanks and 
infantry supported by massed artillery and air power. 

During this campaign, the Russian Black Sea Fleet inter- 
cepted enemy efforts to evacuate troops. A total of 191 ves- 
sels, including 69 transports, was sunk. With the fall of 
Sevastopol the Red Army claimed that 50,000 troops had 
been killed in the Crimea and 61,000 had surrendered. 

Results of the Winter Offensive 

In the winter campaigns of 1944 the Red Army raised the 
siege of Leningrad, pushed the Nazis back to the Pripet 
Marshes in the center, and swept them out of southern Rus- 
sia into Poland and Rumania. These drives restored most of 
the USSR to the Soviet peoples. Now Red armies were in a 
position to free the Baltic states, Poland, and the Balkans, 
and to drive the Nazis back where they came from. The 
enemy had lost the power to mount a sustained offensive 
after Stalingrad and the later drives in the winter of 1943. 
In 1944 his defensive power was slowly sapped. It was esti- 
mated that he had lost eight divisions at Korsun and the 
fighting strength of at least another ten in his retreat from 
the Dnieper Bend. What reserves he had left, he would need 
in France and Italy to oppose the British and Americans. 
The United Nations were ready to crush him in the nut- 
cracker made at Teheran where Churchill, Roosevelt, and 
Stalin planned the final blows to fall in 1944 from east and 
west, north and south.

PART SEVEN 

TRIUMPH OF THE UNITED 
NATIONS. 

The spring of 1944 brought a period of mounting tension 
and secrecy to Europe. No one outside the Allied High Com- 
mand knew exactly where or when the great American and 
British offensive against Germany would be launched from 
the west. But the whole world had been told in the winter 
months following the Teheran Conference that some time in 
1944 the United Nations would strike Hitler-held Europe 
from all directions. The first blows were delivered from the 
south in Italy by the veteran Fifth and Eighth Armies, 
which captured Rome and pursued the disorganized Nazis 
north to the Arno River. Next came the American and British 
landings in Normandy, prepared by a powerful air offensive 
against Germany and followed by two Russian offensives 
from the east, the first to knock Finland out of the war and 
the second a major drive to the Baltic Sea and deep into 
Poland. The great offensive to crush Germany was well under 
way by the summer of 1944. Never before had strategy been 
applied on such a grand scale to liberate all Europe by 
a continental pincers attack with the combined force of 
millions of armed men. With these armies and this strategy, 
the United Nations were able to crush Fascism in Europe 
and to defeat its strongest protagonist, the Germany of 
Adolf Hitler. 

The development of a strategy of coalition for the defeat 
of Germany began in the spring of 1943 when the Combined 
Chiefs of Staff drew up plans for the Anglo-American inva- 
sion of France. These plans, which even designated the land- 
ing beaches, were approved in August 1943, at the Quebec 
Conference by President Roosevelt and Prime Minister 
Churchill. At Teheran, in December, they discussed the pro- 
jected invasion with Premier Stalin, and agreed to mount it 
at the end of May or the beginning of June 1944, when 

258 



all the Russian armies would also take the offensive again 
in the east. 

Following the Teheran Conference, changes were made in 
the Anglo-American command to prepare for the great drive 
in the west. General (now General of the Army) Dwight D. 
Eisenhower was transferred from the Mediterranean to be- 
come Supreme Allied Commander in Western Europe, with 
Lieutenant General Walter B. Smith, Chief of Staff; Air 
Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Tedder, Deputy Supreme Com- 
mander; Field Marshal Sir Bernard L, Montgomery, com- 
manding all ground forces; General Omar N. Bradley, com- 
manding American ground troops; Air Chief Marshal 
Trafford L. Leigh-Mallory, in charge of all Allied Expedition- 
ary Air Forces; Lieutenant General (now General) Carl 
Spaatz of U. S. Strategic Bomber Forces, and Air Chief 
Marshal Sir Arthur T. Harris, of British Strategic Bombers; 
Admiral Sir Bertram Ramsey, in command of Allied Naval 
Forces, with Vice Admiral Alan G. Kirk commanding U. S. 
naval units participating in the invasion; and Lieutenant 
General John C. H. Lee in charge of American supply in 
England and the European rear areas. 

The Mediterranean Theater was likewise reorganized. 
General (now Field Marshal) Sir Henry Maitland Wilson 
took supreme command, uniting the eastern and western 
Mediterranean, with Lieutenant General (now General) 
Jacob L. Devers as his American deputy. General (now Field 
Marshal) Sir Harold Alexander commanded the Allied Cen- 
tral Mediterranean Forces in Italy, which were made up of 
the British Eighth Army under Lieutenant General Sir Oliver 
Leese, succeeding Marshal Montgomery, and the British- 
American Fifth Army under Lieutenant General (now Gen- 
eral) Mark W. Clark. Lieutenant Geneal Ira C. Eaker took 
command of the Allied Air Forces in the Mediterranean, with 
Air Marshal Sir John C. Slessor as deputy, Major General 
(now Lieutenant General) Nathan F. Twining, commanding 
the U. S. Fifteenth Air Force, and Major General John K. 
Cannon, the Twelfth Air Force. Admiral Sir Andrew Cun- 
ningham remained in command of all Mediterranean naval 
forces, and Vice Admiral Henry K. Hewitt of the American 
naval forces.

29. AIR OFFENSIVE AGAINST GERMANY 

In two and a half years of war, from Pearl Harbor to the 
middle of May 1944, the United States Army Air Forces 
dealt severe blows to the Axis. During this period they 
dropped 468,391 tons of bombs on enemy targets all over 
the world and destroyed 20,174 enemy planes — 16,510 in 
aerial combat and 3,664 on the ground. In the course of 
these activities they lost in action a total of 6,154 planes — 
5,718 in the air, 236 on the ground, and 200 noncombat 
craft. Of their operations, on all fronts, the strategic bomb- 
ing of Germany and German-occupied Europe was the most 
destructive and the longest offensive ever carried out from 
the air against an enemy. It was the greatest demonstration 
of modern air power. For two years, from the spring of 1942 
through the summer of 1944, British and American bombers 
brought the war home to German soil. Long before Europe 
could be invaded by land, the roof of the Continent was 
torn off, and from a "second front" in the skies the bombs 
rained down on enemy cities, industries, and communica- 
tions. The air attack was a necessary preparation for the 
invasion of Europe by land. 

Although strategic bombing worked terrible destruction in 
Germany and inflicted many more casualties on the civilian 
population than any other country suffered, terror was not 
its object. The area bombing of the Royal Air Force at night 
and later the daylight precision bombing of the U. S. Army 
Air Forces were both directed primarily at military targets. 
First came the submarine pens on the French coast and the 
shipyards in Germany, because the U-boats threatened to 
starve Britain and isolate the United States; next the fac- 
tories which produced planes, ball bearings, synthetic oil, 
and critical war materiel, for these were the sources of Nazi 
strength in the air; and finally the Luftwaffe, which took 
the air to defend the ground from which it drew its power. 
This order of strategic bombing was followed by tactical 
bombing of the railroads and rolling stock of enemy supply 
lines, over which resistance to our invasions of Italy and 
France was mobilized; then bombers hit the rear areas and 
coastal defenses of the Nazi armies which faced our troops. 

260 



Although there were many other targets, such as the robot- 
bomb installations on the coasts opposite England, the in- 
dustries of the Rhineland, and the ports on. the Baltic Sea, 
they were accessory to the main order of strategic and tac- 
tical targets. In the course of this aerial offensive, planned 
scientifically and executed with growing ferocity, British 
and American fliers exhausted the enemy air forces, destroyed 
a large part of the Nazi war industries, and softened up Hit- 
ler-held Europe for the smashing assaults of American, Brit- 
ish, and Russian ground troops. 

Begun by British Bombers 

The air offensive was started by the British under Air Chief 
Marshal Sir Arthur Harris before the United States entered 
the war. Only by air could the British then attack Germany 
directly. From the beginning of 1941 Blenheim bombers 
raided enemy shipping despite heavy losses, in an effort to 
deny the Germans the use of coastal waters. With the Nazi 
invasion of Russia the British policy of bombing was directed 
to any target whose destruction would help the Soviet Union. 
British bomber strength became sufficient in the summer of 
1941 to send three hundred planes over Germany [August 
14, 1941], and toward the end of the year, four hundred in 
a concentrated raid on Berlin [November 7, 1941]. 

In the first phase of Allied bombing [July 1941-February 
1942], during which the Royal Air Force cooperated with 
the Russian ground forces, night raids were made on Ger- 
man rail junctions and war plants to disrupt enemy supply. 
Berlin and Liibeck were the most distant targets; Aachen, 
MiJnster, and Cologne in the Rhineland were most frequently 
raided. 

The second phase, beginning in February 1942, was con- 
centrated on German supplies at their source, the steel works 
of Essen, Diisseldorf, and Cologne, with night raids over Ger- 
many and day raids on the factories of northern France and 
Belgium. A Nazi invasion fleet preparing at Liibeck for a 
descent on Leningrad was broken up in a heavy raid [March 
28, 1942] typical of those which continued to help Soviet 
Russia. 

As the Nazis improved their antiaircraft defenses, a new 

261 



tactic was tried in a blow against the Renault auto and tank 
works near Paris [March 3, 1942]. Bombers were massed for 
a quick run over a single target in order to saturate ground 
defenses. This concentration of offensive power proved so 
effective that it became the pattern of all strategic bombing. 
In the heaviest raid on Cologne [May 30, 1942], one thou- 
sand planes made a saturation attack, dropping three thou- 
sand tons of bombs in ninety minutes, at the rate of one every 
six seconds. Neutral observers estimated that twenty thou- 
sand people were killed and the chemical and machine-tool 
industries seriously dislocated. The next night over one 
thousand planes bombed the Krupp works at Essen. British 
losses in these swift, heavy raids fell from ten to four per cent, 
and the damage suffered by the enemy increased in far great- 
er proportion. Such raids, said Churchill, were "a herald of 
what Germany will receive city by city from now on." 

Reinforced by Americans 

The British bombed chiefly at night ; the Americans joined 
them in the summer of 1942 to start bombing by day. On 
their first independent mission [August 17, 1942], twelve 
Flying Fortresses went more than fifty miles into France, 
dropped eighteen tons of bombs on the railway yards at 
Rouen, and returned to their base in safety. The raid was the 
experimental beginning of daylight precision bombing intro- 
duced by the armored Forts, with their numerous guns, can- 
non and pin-pointing bombsights. The U. S. VIII Bomber 
Command, first under Lieutenant General (now General) 
Carl Spaatz and later under Lieutenant General Ira C. Eaker, 
built up its forces during 1942 and 1943 at seventy-seven 
bases in England, Scotland, and Wales. The average base 
grew until in 1944 it housed over two thousand men with all 
the gasoline, parts, and munitions necessary to keep a bomber 
group of forty-eight to seventy-two Forts or Liberators in op- 
eration. The development of the Britain-based Eighth Air 
Force was interrupted during the winter of 1942-43 by the 
transfer of air strength from Britain to the Mediterranean to 
cover the invasion of North Africa and the Battle of Tunisia. 
To these ground operations the U. S. Eighth and Ninth Air 
Forces contributed most of the air power, and heavy Ameri- 

262 



can bombing of enemy-occupied Europe was consequently 
delayed until the middle of 1943. 

By that time Britain had become primarily a base for air 
power, with over one thousand heavy American bombers. 
When the U. S. Eighth Air Force and the Ninth as its tactical 
and fighter escort were recruited to full strength, they pre- 
pared to carry out the task assigned them at the Casablanca 
Conference, to destroy the German war industries. One year 
after their first experimental raid on Rouen, the American Air 
Forces in Britain were strong enough to strike three blows at 
German industries, each carried out by more than three hun- 
dred Flying Fortresses. Two groups dropped 573 tons of 
bombs on Schweinfurt, center of Nazi ball-bearing produc- 
tion, and fought their way home to England; a third group 
hit fighter-plane factories in Regensburg with 298 tons of 
bombs and flew south across the Alps and the Mediterranean 
on the first shuttle to American bases in North Africa [Au- 
gust 17, 1942]. A week later they bombed Bordeaux on their 
way back to England. 

In their first year of bombing Europe, American planes 
flew 124 missions from British bases, dropped 16,977 tons of 
bombs on enemy targets, destroyed 2,050 Nazi fighter planes, 
and lost 472 bombers with 4,481 men, including the missing 
and captured. Except for the large number of enemy fighters 
destroyed, these operations probably did not accomplish more 
than one-fifth of what the RAF was able to achieve with its 
greater bomb capacity and heavier night raids. In its first 
year of operations, for example, theU. S. Eighth Air Force 
dropped about 15,000 tons of bombs on enemy-occupied 
Europe, while the RAF dropped 136,000 tons. 

In 1942, during the experimental phase of their operations, 
American bombers had concentrated on submarine bases and 
nearby targets in occupied France. By the summer of 1943 
they were ready to penetrate deep into Germany. The Flying 
Fortress proved to be not only an efficient daylight bomber, 
despite its limited capacity compared to Liberators and Brit- 
ish Lancasters, but it was also a much better fighter than any 
other heavy bomber. The unexpected fighting strength of the 
Flying Fortress contributed to the great tactical surprises 
achieved by our air forces. 

263 



Joint Anglo-American Air Offensive 

The success of American daylight precision bombing per- 
suaded the Combined Chiefs of Staff, meeting at Casablanca, 
to order a joint British and American air offensive against 
Germany. Their mission was "the progressive destruction and 
dislocation of the German military, industrial, and economic 
system and the undermining of the morale of the German 
people to the point where their capacity for armed resistance 
is fatally weakened." In the language of the fliers, Germany 
was to be "softened up" for invasion. Until an invasion could 
be mounted, an attempt was to be made to knock Germany 
out of the war by air power. 

British and American bombers were to alternate, the RAF 
with area bombing at night and the U. S. AAF with target 
bombing by day, in a round-the-clock schedule. In this divi- 
sion of labor the RAF struck at the German cities to destroy 
their resources and morale, while the U. S. Eighth Air Force 
aimed its bombs at key factories in German war industry. 
The offensive began in the summer of 1943 with night flights 
of eight hundred British planes, followed by day flights of 
three hundred American bombers. 

As summer weather enabled the Allied offensive to increase 
in power, the Nazi aircraft industry shifted its production 
from bombers to fighters, a sure sign that in the air Germany 
was being forced back from offensive to defensive. To fore- 
stall these aerial reinforcements the U. S. VIII Bomber Com- 
mand in July attacked Focke-Wulf factories which were es- 
timated to produce sixty-five per cent of the Nazi fighters. 
The airplane tire factories at Huls and ball-bearing plants at 
Schweinfurt were also heavily bombed. Flights over such 
vital areas sharply increased American losses. On their anni- 
versary raids over Schweinfurt and Regensburg, the Eighth 
Air Force lost more planes in one day [August 17, 1943] 
than it had lost in the first six months of its flights over 
Europe. The air war threatened to become a war of attrition, 
but the Allies were bound to win it. One thousand four- 
engined heavy bombers alone came every month from 
American factories. 

While planes based in England attacked the Axis day and 

264 



night from the west, Liberators of the U. S. Ninth and 
Twelfth Air Forces in North Africa hit targets all over Italy, 
the Messerschmitt factories near Vienna [August 13, 1943], 
and the Ploesti oilfields in Rumania [August 1, 1943]. The 
last mission was notable for the low-level bombing run 
of 162 Libya-based B-24s which flew a round trip of 2,400 
miles. In the month of September, which saw the greatest air 
fights in Europe since the Battle of Britain, the U. S. Eighth 
Air Force alone dropped 8,190 tons of bombs, more than 
double the tonnage of any previous month. 

To oppose the mounting British and American attack, the 
Nazis increased their concentrations of antiaircraft batteries 
and fighter squadrons in Germany. During the first half of 
1943 they doubled the number of single-engine fighters in a 
vain effort to neutralize American daylight raiders. The 
necessity of defending their own country and its vital war 
plants robbed the Germans of air superiority on the Russian 
and Italian fronts. By the middle of 1943 it was estimated 
that the Nazis had 39,000 antiaircraft guns and over half 
their fighter-plane strength on the western air front. Perhaps 
a milHon men operated the guns, searchlights, and barrage 
balloons on the ground, and at least one in every ten civilians 
was busy all or part of the time with air-raid defense and 
rescue work. 

Defensive tactics varied as the Germans experimented with 
novel means to break up the growing assault of Allied bomb- 
ers. Nazi fighter-bombers, powered with twin engines, waited 
beyond the range of the bombers' guns and harried them 
with rockets. Messerschmitt 109s and Focke-Wulf 190s 
pounced upon any bomber which dropped out of formation. 

Although the average loss of Flying Fortresses did not 
exceed four per cent of the planes engaged, they required 
fighter protection to avoid high casualties on some missions 
and to make smooth, uninterrupted bombing runs. Light- 
nings, Thunderbolts, and Mustangs by the hundreds escort- 
ed them, giving Allied bombers better protection than the 
Luftwaffe had ever furnished its own planes and targets. The 
American fighters often registered a four-to-one score against 
the Nazi rocket-carriers. Nothing the enemy did could stop 
the Allied bombers: through flak, fighters, aerial bombs, and 

265 



rockets, the Fortresses, Liberators, and Lancasters flew re- 
lentlessly on to bomb their targets. Some of the Amercian 
planes, dubbed by their crews Memphis Belle, Bat Out a 
Hell, The Sweater Girl, and Flak-Happy, became as famous 
in the sky as warships of old on the seas. 

From the first sorties flown by our Air Forces to the be- 
ginning of 1944, British and American bombers had dropped 
330,000 tons of bombs on Germany alone; to this total the 
U. S. Eighth Air Force contributed 50,000 tons during 1943. 
On 64,000 sorties they lost almost one thousand heavy bomb- 
ers and claimed the destruction of 4,100 Nazi planes. From 
the Mediterranean Theater, during 1943, the Northwest 
Africa Strategic Air Force and the U. S. Fifteenth Air Force 
dropped 74,000 tons of bombs on Axis targets in Africa, 
Sicily, Italy, the Balkans, and Germany. Still the German 
armies fought on. 

By the early winter of 1944, however, it had become clear 
that, despite the weight of the Allied aerial attack, Germany 
could not be crushed by air power alone. It had sustained 
staggering damage but never more than could be repaired. 
The greatest weakness of the bombing attack was that the 
destruction of German war industry was temporary, not per- 
manent; and while total production steadily declined, it was 
not stopped. 

Reduction of German Air Power 

Through the winter of 1943-44 Allied planes sought to 
destroy German air power so that the troops invading Europe 
would meet only the enemy ground forces. The German fight- 
er planes were the quarry of every mission. "We realized," 
said General Arnold [May 18, 1944], ''that we had to get 
them in the factories, in the modification centers, the depots, 
the flying fields and in the air." General Arnold estimated 
that after six months of heavy raids the combat strength of 
the Luftwaffe was undiminished. All its reserves were gone, 
however, and three-fourths of the enemy plane production 
was thought to be destroyed. 

The winter campaign against the German aircraft industry 
began [January 11, 1944] with daylight raids on Oschersle- 
ben, Brunswick, Halberstadt, and other industrial centers at 

266 



a cost of fifty-nine American bombers. Despite this heavy 
loss, the attacks continued through the next six weeks [Janu- 
ary 11-February 22, 1944] with the percentage of losses 
among bombers engaged dropping to 2.2. The decHne in 
casualties was explained by three facts. First, the Luftwaffe 
suffered from cumulative strain, because of the alternating 
British and American raids night and day. As an example of 
the Germans' inability to sustain around-the-clock defenses, a 
night raid on Leipzig [February 20, 1944] cost the British 
seventy-nine aircraft. The next day, when Americans at- 
tacked, all but twenty-one bombers returned safely. Some- 
times the ratio was reversed, the Americans losing more than 
the British; but the Germans, on 24-hour alert, suffered 
twice as much as either of them. Another factor in decreasing 
American losses was the marksmanship of our gunners, which 
was good to begin with and improved with practice. Most 
important, however, was the tremendous strength of each 
American mission, with fighters escorting bombers. American 
air power had been reinforced to a point where on any mis- 
sion, eight hundred bombers could range over Europe in 
broad daylight with seven hundred fighters. 

The climax of the winter campaign came in February, dur- 
ing a spell of clear weather called ''BHtz Week," [February 
20-25, 1944] when the Britain-based Eighth and the Italy- 
based Fifteenth Air Forces combined in a heavy assault on 
the Nazi aircraft factories at Leipzig, Brunswick, Hanover, 
Stuttgart, Schweinfurt, Regensburg, and other cities. Against 
factories producing two-thirds of the German fighter planes, 
the Americans made 3,800 bomber and 4,300 fighter sorties 
in one week, cutting enemy production in half for at least the 
next month. Nazi losses in the air were also heavy. During 
the whole month of February it was estimated that nine hun- 
dred enemy fighters were shot down on raids which cost 250 
American bombers. 

Berlin was a special target because of its importance as an 
industrial city, and the enemy defended it heavily with 
fighter planes. The RAF had started the aerial Battle of Ber- 
lin [November 18, 1943-February 15, 1944], dropping over 
twenty thousand tons of bombs on the city, destroying or 
damaging 326 factories, and losing nearly five hundred 

267 



bombers. The Americans took over the attack on Berlin in 
March 1944, with nine heavy daylight raids in which they 
shot down 524 planes and lost 242 bombers. These raids were 
made in great force. On one mission, for example [March 8, 
1944], over two thousand American planes, divided between 
bombers and fighters, dropped 350,000 incendiary and 10,- 
000 demolition bombs. In the course of six raids it was esti- 
mated that seventy-four vital German war plants were dam- 
aged or destroyed. Berlin became a ruined city when nearly 
half of its central area was burned out. 

The first phase of the strategic bombing of Germany 
[February 20-March 9, 1944] ended with the intensive oper- 
ations from Blitz Week through the March raids on Berlin. 
During these two weeks the U. S. Eighth and Fifteenth Air 
Forces, comprising eighty thousand flying men, the equiva- 
lent of eight mechanized divisions, penetrated deep into en- 
emy country. They dropped over seventeen thousand tons of 
bombs on industrial targets, shot down a thousand enemy 
planes, losing 414 bombers, 121 fighters, and more than four 
thousand men, probably half of whom parachuted to earth 
and were taken prisoners. They bombed single-engine fighter 
factories at Leipzig, Oschersleben, Regensburg, and Steyr; 
twin-engine fighter factories at Brunswick, Gotha, and 
Furth; bomber plants in Bernburg, Rostock, and Halber- 
stadt; and ball-bearing shops at Schweinfurt and Stuttgart. 
It was believed that German fighter production had been cut, 
at least temporarily, by two-thirds since the beginning of 
1944, and the output of bombers by one-third. 

Pre-Invasion Assault 

The fury of the Allied strategic bombing of Europe in- 
creased during April and May in preparation for the invasion 
of France. During April, British and American planes broke 
all bombing records, dropping 81,000 tons of incendiaries and 
high explosives on German-held Europe. The U. S. Eighth 
and Fifteenth Air Forces, carrying over half this weight of 
bombs, destroyed 1,282 enemy planes, and lost 537 bombers. 
In May, when the British and Americans together pounded 
enemy supply with 118,000 tons of bombs, the Americans 
dropped 63,000 tons and destroyed 1,200 German planes, 

268 



losing 481 bombers and 235 fighters. There was a growing 
contrast between the large number of Nazi planes shot down 
and the declining number of American aircraft which were 
lost. Fighters escorting our bombers reported that in May 
they were meeting only half the force of enemy fighters en- 
countered in the winter months. It was evident that the 
strength of the Luftwaffe had been seriously reduced. 

Tactical Preparation for the Invasion 

Besides the strategic bombing to reduce air power and 
weaken industries in Germany, it was necessary to undertake 
tactical bombing in preparation for the invasion, to destroy 
enemy lines of communication and supply in the assault area. 
To assist the light and medium bombers of the U. S. Eighth 
Air Force in this work, the Ninth Air Force was transferred 
from the Mediterranean to British bases. These two air 
forces, the Eighth under Lieutenant General James H. Doo- 
little and the Ninth under Lieutenant General Lewis H. 
Brereton, started the tactical bombing of railroads and 
bridges from Germany into France during April. Thirty-four 
railways yards were wrecked. 

The first full phase of tactical bombing, beginning a month 
before D-day, was directed against the bridges across the 
Seine River from Paris northwest to the English Channel. 
This phase of the attack was the special mission of the 
Ninth Air Force, which used Marauders, Havocs, and 
Thunderbolts to knock out twenty-three of the largest 
bridges in thirty-five days. Without these crossings the Seine 
was a barrier dividing northern France and seriously delaying 
the reinforcement of German troops west of the river. 

Bombing in the second phase was aimed at the bridges and 
choke points in the gap between Paris and Orleans, and 
particularly at the bridges across the Loire River, which were 
all destroyed by the middle of June. The Eighth Air Force 
joined the Ninth in this work, and all heavy bombers were 
pressed into service. Even Mustang and Lightning fighters 
were fitted out with thousand-pound bombs. They bombed 
and strafed traffic on the roads in the seventy-mile corridor 
between the Seine and Loire, isolating Normandy and Brit- 
tany from the rest of France. 

269 



The third phase began with D-day and belongs with the 
story of the Allied landings in Normandy. The invasion had 
been prepared by both strategic and tactical bombing: the 
former spread confusion and destruction through the German 
zone of the interior and neutralized German air power, while 
the latter upset enemy supply lines into France, choked up 
traffic in the French theater of operations, and sealed off 
Normandy and Brittany for assault. 



30. THE RUSSIAN OFFENSIVES 

During the spring of 1944, the Russians prepared to mount 
stronger offensives than ever before, regrouping armies, 
extending railroads, and bringing up to the Eastern Front 
vast quantities of supplies and munitions. According to re- 
ports, Germany and her satellites had over 270 divisions 
holding this front, of which 200 were German, 28 Rumanian, 
20 Hungarian, and 15 Finnish, all grouped in nine armies. 
Ready to engage them were Soviet forces of more than 300 
divisions, grouped in ten armies from the Gulf of Finland 
to the Black Sea. 

Knocking Finland Out of the War 

The Russians began their summer operations with a cam- 
paign on the Leningrad front to knock Finland out of the 
war. Throughout the war six German and fifteen Finnish 
divisions in this sector had maintained a tenacious grip on 
the coveted territory of Karelia, only twenty miles above 
Leningrad. The Russians, attacking in great force with over- 
powering artillery [June 10, 1944], drove the Finns back 
along the northern shore of the Gulf of Finland to the old 
Mannerheim Line. This line, no longer as strong as in 1940^ 
was quickly penetrated [June 18, 1944]. With the capture 
of Viipuri (Viborg) [June 20, 1944], some twenty-five miles 
beyond, however, the Russians came to a region of marshes 
and lakes easily defended by the Finns, who threw back a 
Soviet amphibious expedition across Viipuri Bay [July 1-7, 
1944]. 

Meanwhile, the Russians launched another drive to the 

270 



east [June 21, 1944], in the Aunus Isthmus, and swept for- 
ward more than 150 miles between Lakes Ladoga and Onega. 
Still another drive farther north freed the ship canal from 
Leningrad to the White Sea. These two offensives met with 
stubborn Finnish resistance but made far greater progress 
than the one in Karelia. 

Under steady pressure from the Russian forces, Finland 
finally slipped out of the German noose and concluded an 
armistice with the Soviet Union and Great Britain. The 
Finns had rejected Russian peace terms in the spring of 
1944 [March 8, April 19, 1944]. By summer they were iso- 
lated and weak. The United States had broken off diplomatic 
relations with Finland [June 30, 1944] because she had 
"entered into a hard and fast military partnership with Nazi 
Germany." Germany could no longer give Finland any mili- 
tary support. Hence the Finns finally made an armistice 
[September 4, 1944] that guaranteed their political inde- 
pendence. Fighting broke out [September 23, 1944] between 
German and Finnish troops over the failure of the Germans 
to evacuate Finnish territory. 

Strategy and Tactics 

The three Russian drives against Finland were minor 
operations in the major offensives which the Red armies 
launched against Germany along the entire Eastern Front of 
1,300 miles from the Gulf of Finland to the Black Sea. Even 
these vast offensives were but part of the concentric blows 
struck by the United States, Great Britain, and the Soviet 
Union. Before the Russians went into action in the summer 
of 1944, American and British armies had opened a second 
front in France and extended the third front, established ten 
months before in Italy. The drive to carry the war to Ger- 
man territory began on three sides of Hitler-held Europe. 
Victory on every one of these sides was necessary to liberate 
Europe. 

The long Russian front was divided into four theaters, 
from which the Red armies launched four major offensives in 
the summer of 1944. The Baltic front extended from the 
Gulf of Finland south to Vitebsk, where it joined two White 
Russian fronts, separated by the Pripet Marshes but con- 

271 



verging on Poland; in the far south the Rumanian front ran 
west of the Dniester River to the Black Sea. 

It was on the southern (White Russian) front that the Red 
Army had advanced farthest towards Poland and Rumania in 
the late winter and early spring of 1944. Here across the 
fiat, open country below the Pripet Marshes the Germans 
evidently expected them to open their summer offensive. 
All through the spring German planes bombed supply and 
communication lines in the south of Russia and massed their 
reserves to meet the expected attack. The Russians surprised 
the Germans by striking in the north, and then it was nearly 
three weeks before Axis reserves could be brought north to 
stem the Russian drive. Meanwhile the Red Army had 
broken down the enemy's defenses. 

Then, with the flexibility which had characterized earlier 
Russian offensives, the Red armies went into action against 
the now vulnerable southern front. Their strategic policy was 
literally to follow the line of least resistance, and their ability 
to shift the attack wherever the enemy was weakest arose 
from their great superiority in men and materiel. With over- 
whelming strength in artillery and tactical bombing planes, 
the Russians laid down rolling barrages of shells and bombs 
to open every offensive. They had learned in 1943 the telling 
effect of massive fire power, and used it in 1944 to blast 
enemy strongpoints. 

By summer the Red armies were so completely mechanized 
they advanced with the same speed which the Germans had 
displayed when they introduced blitzkrieg to the world. More 
remarkable was the fact that although their advance aver- 
aged a mile an hour, day and night, in the first nine days 
of the summer offensives, their supply kept pace with the 
lengthening lines. Such speed was due in part to 300,000 
American Lend-Lease trucks which kept rolling forward with 
the tanks and mechanized artillery. 

The tactics with which the Russians drove west on all 
fronts took two forms. In one, a pincers movement, two 
armies converged on a strongpoint. The other was a more 
elaborate movement in which each army advanced in three 
elements. The first made a frontal assault on a strongpoint; 
the second outflanked and encircled the strongpoint; and the 

272 



third took advantage of the second's advance and pressed 
forward as rapidly as possible, either to outflank another ene- 
my position or to cut off the retreat of forces falling back 
from the first point of attack. Thus each army was in effect 
a hammer, a sickle, and a scythe, pounding and cutting the 
enemy to pieces. The Germans gave ground to avoid an en- 
circlement comparable to the one they suffered at Stalingrad; 
but they fell back so slowly, hanging on to most positions as 
long as they could and leaving behind heavy-footed infantry 
for rear guards, that as a result many divisions were cut up, 
captured, or destroyed. 

Drive to the Baltic 

The Russian summer offensives opened as two Red armies 
joined in a pincers attack on Vitebsk [June 22, 1944], the 
hinge of the Baltic and northern White Russian fronts, which 
was held by five German divisions. The city was outflanked 
by the Russians, who broke through the fortified zone in the 
south and repulsed two German reserve divisions rushed 
forward to prevent encirclement of the city. As the larger 
part of the German garrison evacuated Vitebsk [June 24, 
1944], the Russians caught them in the rear at the Dvina 
River, and after a battle lasting two days [June 26-27, 1944] 
reported that 20,000 enemy troops were killed and 10,000 
captured. 

The Russian attack now swung north against the Baltic 
front in an effort to trap the thirty divisions which the 
Germans were believed to have in the former states of Lithu- 
ania, Latvia, and Estonia. To perform this mission, three 
Red armies took up the offensive, one after the other, from 
south to north on the Baltic front. The First Baltic Army, 
having outflanked Vitebsk on the north, crossed the Berezina 
River under German counterattacks, bypassed and captured 
the strongpoint of Polotsk [July 4, 1944], guarding the 
Baltic front, and turned northwest towards Dvinsk and Riga, 
advancing at the rate of three miles a day. They slowed 
down, however, as they entered a difficult country of lakes 
and swamps and met strong German reinforcements. 

Then the Second Baltic Army launched an offensive [July 
11, 1944] farther north into Latvia. It finally reached the 

273 



Baltic Sea west of Riga [August 1, 1944] and threatened 
to cut off the enemy forces to the north, but sustained Ger- 
man counterattacks reopened a narrow corridor near the 
coast. Here the Germans were hard-pressed by the Third 
Baltic Army, which swung into action last, broke through 
enemy defenses below Pskov, captured this strongpoint, and 
pushed into Estonia [July 22, 1944]. Throughout the Baltic 
there was hard, confused fighting. Although the German 
forces in this theater were not entirely isolated, they were 
divided into two groups by the Russian thrust toward Riga, 
and their bases in East Prussia were dangerously exposed 
by the advance of other Red armies farther south. 

Drive to East Prussia and Warsaw 

While the Russians on the Baltic front were drawing 
their nets around the enemy, three Red armies on the north 
White Russian front rolled into action from Vitebsk south 
to the Pripet Marshes and drove forward through Poland 
[June 22, 23, 25, 1944]. East Prussia was the goal of one 
army, the northernmost or Third White Russian under Gen- 
eral Ivan D. Chernyakovsky ; Warsaw, the capital of Poland, 
was the objective of the other two. All three armies cooper- 
ated at the start of the summer offensive in outflanking the 
strongpoints on the main railroad leading to Warsaw — Orsha, 
Borisov, and Minsk [June 27, July 1, 3, 1944]. In addition, 
elements of each army swung left or right to the army along- 
side, to envelop the remaining strongpoints on the White 
Russian front. Vitebsk, Mogilev, and Bobruisk fell in turn 
during the first ten days of the summer advance [June 26, 
28, July 1, 1944]. 

The Russians won the initial phase of this offensive at two 
decisive points. Chernyakovsky 's northern forces, after out- 
flanking Vitebsk, swept south and broke through the German 
defenses [July 1, 1944] on a front of sixty miles above Bori- 
sov and Minsk, compelling the enemy to evacuate these cities. 
The Germans east of Minsk fell back, hoping to catch the 
advancing Russians on the flank. Instead they were caught 
and badly cut up by the other White Russian armies, one 
pounding their front, another their rear [July 1-6, 1944]. 
Because the southernmost of these armies, the First White 

274 



Russian under Marshal Konstantin Rokossovsky, was largely 
motorized, it had been able to sweep forward forty miles in 
two days [June 25-26, 1944] at the start of the offensive, 
and after the battle near Minsk it drove west to capture 
Baranovichi [July 8, 1944] and upset the enemy on his 
second line of defense. 

In the second phase of the summer campaign the Germans 
brought up reserves [July 4-5, 1944] from the inactive front 
below the Pripet Marshes to reinforce the line from Vilna 
through Baranovichi to Pinsk. But the center of this line 
had been cut by Rokossovsky's earlier drive, and the north- 
ern anchor at Vilna fell to Chernyakovsky's army [July 13, 
1944], as it advanced from Minsk toward East Prussia. 
While Rokossovsky cleaned up pockets of the enemy in the 
Pripet Marshes, the Germans fell back to the last line of 
resistance on White Russian soil [July 14-18, 1944], from 
the Bug River north through Bialystok and Grodno to 
Kaunas. This line crumbled as had the other two, because 
of the swift Russian advance upon both ends. Grodno fell 
in the north [July 16, 1944], outflanked by Chernyakovsky, 
and in the south Rokossovsky swept forward to the Bug 
above Brest-Litovsk [July 18, 1944]. Stiff resistance at this 
point slowed down his advance on Warsaw. 

All the German forces on the Polish front covering War- 
saw were menaced by a new offensive, the third major drive 
of the summer, from the front south of the Pripet Marshes. 
Shortly after the Germans withdrew their reserves from this 
area, evacuating Kowel, two Russian armies under Marshal 
Ivan S. Konev leaped to the attack on a front of one hundred 
miles, crossed the Bug River, and drove northwest toward 
the Vistula below Warsaw [July 14, 1944]. They split the 
German forces in the south of Poland by encircling Lwow 
and capturing Lublin [July 25, 1944]. In the face of this 
threat to turn their entire right flank north of the Bug, the 
Germans fell back on Warsaw and East Prussia. Rokossov- 
sky took Brest-Litovsk [July 28, 1944] and advanced to the 
north of Warsaw, bringing the suburbs of the city under fire 
of his artillery. At the same time [August 17, 1944] Chernya- 
kovsky arrived at the borders of East Prussia. Konev's armies 
in the south had meanwhile diverged, one turning southwest 

275 



to capture two thousand oil wells in Polish Galicia [August 
7 , 1944] the other moving west and almost reaching Krakow 
after it had shattered the German defenses on the Vistula 
River [August 4, 1944]. This breakthrough was the last 
great advance of the Russians in Poland for the remaining 
three weeks of August. All along the line from East Prussia 
through Warsaw to the Krakow front the Germans, rein- 
forced by reserves from within Germany, launched strong 
counterattacks. 

In the first month of the summer offensive on the Eastern 
front [June 22-July 23, 1944] six Russian armies had moved 
toward the Baltic Sea and into Poland an average distance 
of two hundred miles. During this advance Moscow reported 
that 381,410 enemy soldiers were killed on the Baltic, White 
Russian, and Polish fronts. On the White Russian and Polish 
fronts alone, military prisoners numbered 150,231 Germans, 
including twenty-two generals. Estimates of the number of 
enemy divisions destroyed during the first ten days of the 
offensive ranged from fifteen to twenty-two, and many addi- 
tional units were cut up in the weeks that followed. During 
the first month of the offensive the Russians reported the 
capture of 631 aircraft, 2,635 tanks and self-propelled guns, 
8,602 field guns, and 57,152 trucks. 

Of such losses, and of all the earlier casualties which the 
Germans suffered during three years of war in Russia, Prime 
Minister Churchill said [August 2, 1944] : "It is the Russian 
Army that has done the main work of tearing the guts out of 
the German Army. In the air and on the ocean and seas we 
can maintain ourselves, but there was no force in the world 
which could have been called into being except after several 
more years that would have been able to maul and break the 
German Army and subject it to such terrible slaughter and 
manhandling as has fallen upon the Germans by the Russian 
Soviet armies." 

Collapse of the Balkans 

The drives at the northern end of the Russian line had not 
yet stirred the southernmost front, from the Carpathian 
Mountains to the Black Sea, into activity. The signal for 
the launching of a new Russian offensive on this front came 

276 



as the advance on other fronts lost momentum through enemy 
resistance and inevitable delays in moving forward supplies. 
While the northern armies repulsed German counterattacks 
[August 13-19, 1944] in the Baltic, along the borders of 
East Prussia, and in front of Warsaw and Krakow, two Red 
armies under Generals Malinovsky and Tolbukhin took the 
offensive [August 20, 1944] around Jassy and farther east in 
Bessarabia. Their objective was to knock Rumania out of 
the war. 

Jassy fell to a pincers movement which encircled twelve 
enemy divisions [August 25, 1944] . Then the Russians broke 
through Rumanian defenses and reached the Danube River 
on a front of eighty-five miles, capturing Constanza. the 
Black Sea port at the mouth of the Danube [August 29, 
1944] . They claimed that 205,000 Axis troops were killed or 
captured in the first week of the breakthrough [August 20- 
26, 1944]. This blow compelled Rumania, long a reluctant 
partner of Germany, to change sides overnight. Young King 
Michael ousted Marshal Antonescu, the Prime Minister 
[August 23, 1944], and ordered the Rumanians to turn upon 
the Nazis and above all, to fight Hungary in order to regain 
Transylvania. 

The collapse of Rumania, with Russian forces rushing 
through the Galati Gap [August 30-31, 1944] to seize the 
Ploesti oil fields and occupy Bucharest, turned the whole 
eastern front of the Axis, which had been anchored on the 
Black Sea, and threatened to cut off fifteen German divisions 
in the Balkans. The capture of Ploesti, the last natural source 
of oil left to Germany, was no longer of great strategic im- 
portance, because the Mediterranean Allied Air Forces, ac- 
cording to General Eaker, had destroyed three-quarters of 
its production in a year of bombing raids from Africa and 
Italy. 

As Russian forces swept through Rumania to the southern 
frontier, the adjoining country of Bulgaria showed signs of 
deserting the Axis camp. Yet the Bulgars were content to 
declare their 'neutrality" and rejected the Russian demand 
that they enter the war against Germany, a necessity if the 
German troops stationed in the lower Balkans were to be cap- 
tured. Impatient of delay, Russia declared war on Bulgaria 

277 



[September 5, 1944], and the Bulgars at once turned upon 
Hitler and joined the war against him. 

The Russian penetration of the Balkans deprived Hitler 
of all his allies except Hungary and opened the southern flank 
of Germany to the threat of invasion through Hungary, 
Austria, and Czechoslavakia. Russian forces in Rumania 
pushed west to the Iron Gate leading into Yugoslavia, where 
for more than a year the Partisan guerrillas under Marshal 
Tito had been holding down 125,000 Axis troops. With troops 
in Greece and the ^gean Islands, Germany could only try 
to retain control of escape routes through Yugoslavia, parts 
of which had always been in a state of siege. As the Russians 
moved toward a junction with Tito's guerrillas, the liberation 
of the entire Balkan Peninsula was in sight. 



31. STRATEGIC ADVANCE TOWARD JAPAN 

The American offensive in the Central Pacific entered a 
new stage in the summer of 1944 with the conquest of Saipan 
and Tinian, and the reconquest of Guam. These islands, be- 
longing to the Marianas group, were strong Japanese bases 
about fifteen hundred air miles south of Tokyo and east 
of the Philippines. With the penetration of the southern 
Marianas, American naval forces entered the inner-oceanic 
defenses of Japan and won possession of advanced air and 
naval bases for carrying the offensive forward both to the 
Philippines and Japan. The Japanese were thrown back on 
the strategic and tactical defensive everywhere, except in 
China and Burma, by the overwhelming superiority of the 
American power in the Pacific. The U. S. Navy, now five 
times stronger than the Japanese, could challenge them with 
planes and ships even in the far Pacific. The attack on Saipan 
was such a challenge; it led to the First Battle of the Philip- 
pine Sea, which cost the Japanese their best naval air pilots 
and much of their carrier strength. 

First Battle of the Philippine Sea 

The U. S. naval task forces which arrived off Saipan were 
large enough to engage the entire Japanese Navy if it chose 
278 



to give battle. Admiral Raymond A. Spruance was in top 
command, with carrier fleets operating under Admirals 
Mitscher, Clark, Ragsdale and Connolly. Admiral Turner 
commanded the amphibious forces. Planes from the carriers 
bombed Saipan, Tinian, arid Guam, in the southern Mari- 
anas, for several days [June 11-14, 1944]. Japanese planes 
from an approaching fleet counterattacked, and a great aerial 
battle ensued [June 19, 1944] in which the enemy lost 402 
aircraft and the Americans 27. Three of our ships, one battle- 
ship and two carriers, were slightly damaged. The Japanese 
carriers were apparently stripped of their planes in the great- 
est aerial victory at sea, and ships of Admiral Spruance's 
command chased them halfway to the Philippines [June 20, 
1944]. American planes located the escaping fleet and, by 
admission of the Japanese after the war, sank three carriers 
and two tankers; in addition, they damaged three carriers, 
one battleship, three cruisers, three destroyers and another 
tanker. The enemy ships, fleeing westward in the darkness, ^^ 
left the Americans in undisputed control of the waters around 
the Marianas. The First Battle of the Philippine Sea, like the 
Battles of the Coral Sea and Midway, was fought entirely by 
carrier planes, and although the warships were the objects of 
attack, they did not exchange shots. 

I. BATTLE OF SAIPAN: OPERATION FORAGER 

Before the naval battle, transports had arrived with the 
invasion forces which were to land on the lower west coast 
of Saipan [June 15, 1944]. These forces consisted of the 2nd 
and 4th Marine Divisions under Lieutenant General Holland 
M. Smith, and the 27th Infantry Division under Major Gen- 
eral Ralph C. Smith, with the former in command. Troops 
stormed ashore after dawn in the face of artillery and mor- 
tar fire so strong that it was necessary to call on planes and 
warships for additional support. By noon, however, the 
Marines had secured two shallow beachheads, each two miles 
long, north and south of Charan-Kanoa. In the next two 
days they repulsed strong enemy tank attacks and swung 
north almost to Garapan. The 27th Division wheeled south 
to capture the Aslito air strip [June 19, 1944] , which Seabees 
at once prepared for the use of our own planes. 

279 



Although Saipan is a small island only seventeen miles 
long, the two Japanese divisions holding the northern half 
had the advantage of a mountain range in the center, fifteen 
hundred feet high and honeycombed with caves. There they 
posted mortar and machine-gun batteries for their main line 
of resistance. The American troops could not penetrate this 
line immediately by frontal assaults. With the help of air, 
naval, and artillery fire, they first had to clean out the caves, 
in which the Japanese burrowed so deep that nothing but a 
direct hit could destroy their positions. For eighteen days 
[June 19-Juty 6, 1944] the enemy troops resisted desper- 
ately until they were driven back to a pocket four miles from 
the northern end of Saipan. Then the Japanese made a strong 
but suicidal counterattack [July 7, 1944] which penetrated 
the American artillery line before it was checked. All the 
higher enemy officers fell in this assault, among them Vice 
Admiral Chuichi Nagumo, who had commanded a Japanese 
task force in the attack on Pearl Harbor. This final charge 
ended organized resistance [July 9, 1944] . 

The bitterness of the fighting for Saipan is reflected in the 
total of 15,053 American casualties, of whom 2,359 were 
killed, 11, 481 wounded, and 1,213 missing. The number of 
Japanese buried was 19,793. Over one thousand mihtary 
prisoners were captured, more than in any previous battle 
with the Japanese. The loss of Saipan was so great a shock to 
Japan that the entire Cabinet of General Tojo resigned; at 
the same time, drastic changes were made in the Army and 
Navy high command for the better defense of Asia and the 
home islands [July 19, 1944]. 

Following the conquest of Saipan, the 2nd and 4th Marine 
Divisions under Major General Harry Schmidt, with Rear 
Admiral Harry W. Hill commanding the escort ships, invaded 
and won the smaller island of Tinian [July 23, 1944] which 
lies about two or three miles south of Saipan. The enemy 
put up little resistance as the Marines landed, covered by 
artillery on Saipan, but opposed them with tanks as they 
pushed inland to capture two air strips and storm the town 
of Tinian [July 25, 1944]. When the last remnants of the 
enemy were bottled up at Lalo Point in the south after nine 
days of fighting, all resistance ceased [August 1, 1944]. 

280 



American casualties were relatively light: 195 killed, 1,526 
wounded, and 24 missing. Japanese dead were counted at 
5,745. 

II. RECONQUEST OF GUAM 

The reconquest of Guam, which had been seized by the 
Japanese the day after Pearl Harbor, was prepared by in- 
tensive air and naval bombardment. For seventeen days 
[July 3-20, 1944] carrier planes from the forces under Ad- 
miral Spruance pounded the island and, in addition, de- 
stroyed the garrison at Rota, which lies halfway between 
Saipan and Guam. For a week before the landings, battle- 
ships and cruisers bombarded the western coast of Guam. 

The landing forces consisted of the 3rd Marine Division 
and the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade under Major Gen- 
eral (now Lieutenant General) Roy S. Geiger, reinforced by 
elements of the 77th Infantry Division under Major General 
Andrew D. Bruce. They went ashore [July 20, 1944], meet- 
ing little resistance, on either side of Port Apra and within 
two days cut off the Orote Peninsula in the west. The enemy 
lost two thousand men in night counterattacks. Then the 
Americans drove across Guam to the eastern coast and re- 
duced enemy opposition where it was strongest, in the moun- 
tainous north, by capturing Mount Barrigada [August 3, 
1944]. Organized resistance came to an end after twenty 
days of fighting in which 14,067 Japanese were killed and 
the Americans suffered casualties of 1,226 killed, 5,765 
wounded, and 329 missing. 

The Japanese contested every yard of ground and died 
rather than surrender. In the Central Pacific, from the inva- 
sion of the Gilberts late in 1943 to the conquest of Guam 
ten months later. Admiral Nimitz reported [August 13, 1944] 
that 52,323 Japanese were killed. Only 3,022 were taken 
prisoners. The number of Americans who died was 5,903. 

On July 19, 1945, the Navy announced that 13,932 Jap- 
anese had been killed on Tinian, Guam, and Saipan Islands 
since the islands were secured. 

III. APPROACH TO THE PHILIPPINES 

In the Southwest Pacific, General MacArthur's American 

281 



and Australian forces were making rapid strides on the long 
road toward the Philippine Islands. By the Spring of 1944 
two Japanese armies had been neutralized and isolated in 
Bougainville, New Ireland, and New Britain by Allied ad- 
vances up the Solomons-New Guinea ladder. A third Japa- 
nese army of some sixty-thousand still held the northern 
coast of New Guinea from Madang to the Moluccas. Gen- 
eral MacArthur was now prepared to engage this army, 
whose defeat would give the Allies complete control of the 
island. 

While American and Australian troops faced the enemy 
just before Madang, an amphibious expedition was prepared 
in the Admiralty Islands to land behind the enemy and cut 
his one line of communications, which ran along the coast 
because the interior of New Guinea was impassable jungle. 
Since the U. S. Navy controlled the sea, the enemy's only 
escape from envelopment would be flight into the mountains 
and jungles where there was hardly enough food to sustain 
the scanty native population and nothing to support a large 
army. 

The U. S. 41st Division, escorted by a powerful American 
fleet, with carrier planes destroying one hundred enemy air- 
craft and pounding their airfields [April 21, 1944], secured 
beachheads on a front of 175 miles along the north New 
Guinea coast. The landings were made [April 22, 1944] 
almost unopposed, at Tanahmerah Bay, Hollandia, and 
Aitape, and within four days all three airfields were in Amer- 
ican hands. An Australian division, which landed near Ma- 
dang, advanced eighty miles up the coast toward Wewak 
and Aitape in the course of a month and finally occupied 
Hansa Bay [June 15, 1944], capturing vast stores of enemy 
supplies. Meanwhile, the 41st Division mounted an amphibi- 
ous expedition from Hollandia, captured less than a month 
before, and jumped 125 miles farther west to land at Sarmi 
[May 17, 1944] against little opposition. Then they crossed 
over to the island of Wakde off the New Guinea coast 
[May 21, 1944], and took an enemy airfield, killing 835 
Japanese. This action marked the strategic end of the New 
Guinea campaign, begun at Buna in the fall of 1942, for 

282 



the entire northern coast and its waters were now dominated 
by Allied troops, planes, and ships. 

The Allied forces did not pause. With naval and air cover 
the 41st Division and the 34th Infantry Regiment of the 
24th Division sailed two hundred miles west from Wakde 
and lanked on Biak [May 27, 1944], largest of the Dutch 
Schouten Islands, about nine hundred miles southeast of the 
Philippines. As they pushed inland to capture Mokmer, the 
first of three airfields which were their objectives, they ran 
into fierce Japanese resistance. The first tank engagement 
in the Southwest Pacific took place when Shermans repulsed 
enemy counterattacks [May 29, 1944] spearheaded by me- 
dium tanks. Allied troops poured into the beachhead and 
also landed on Owi and Wundi [June 2,1944], small islands 
to the south of Biak, in order to secure an air strip. Japanese 
attempts to reinforce their troops were frustrated when 
Mitchell bombers sank four enemy destroyers [June 8, 
1944]. American forces finally captured the Mokmer airfield 
by outflanking it from the north, two columns advancing 
up the coast and another along an inland ridge [June 17, 
1944]. Once the enemy was driven from Mokmer, the other 
two- air strips fell into American hands and all organized 
resistance came to an end [June 20, 1944]. In another two 
weeks the Americans mopped up remnants of the enemy: 
altogether 3,268 Japanese were killed and fifteen taken pris- 
oner on Biak. 

About one hundred miles west of Biak lay Noemfoor 
Island, the next objective. For three weeks it was pounded 
by American bombers of the Far Eastern Air Force under 
Lieutenant General George C. Kenney. A merger [June 25, 
1944] of the Fifth Air Force, which had operated in Aus- 
tralia and New Guinea, and the Thirteenth, from the Solo- 
mons and New Britain, had made a force strong enough to 
send 150 heavy bombers on a single mission. In a record as- 
sault [July 1, 1944] for the Southwest Pacific they dropped 
230 tons of bombs on the enemy air base at Noemfoor. The 
158th Regimental Combat Team landed the next day. Rein- 
forced by paratroops of the 503rd Parachute Infantry Regi- 
ment they seized an air strip within three hours and captured 

283 



the last airfield three days later, killing or capturing 871 of 
the enemy [July 6, 1944]. 

The Japanese Eighteenth Army, which had been isolated 
around Wewak in British New Guinea, attempted to break 
through the American lines east of Aitape [July 11, 1944]. 
When their frontal attack across the Driniumor River failed, 
they tried in vain to outflank the Americans [July 18-23, 
1944]. Allied planes blasted their rear [July 28, 1944], 
while cruisers and destroyers came inshore to shell their posi- 
tions. Then the Americans crossed the Driniumor below 
Aitape [July 31, 1944], and drove east along the coast, 
turned south to cut the enemy lines from Wewak, and finally 
split his forces into three groups [August 2, 1944]. It was 
estimated that the Japanese suffered eighteen thousand cas- 
ualties before their effort to break out of encirclement was 
defeated. 

In eleven weeks General MacArthur's forces had ad- 
vanced well over eight hundred miles. By concentrating 
overwhelming power in ships, planes, and men in assaults on 
ports and airfields essential for enemy supply the Allies had 
cut the Japanese in New Guinea into isolated segments which 
would rot in the jungle. We had devised a technique for rapid 
penetration of Japanese defenses and were making giant 
strides toward the Philippines, now only eight hundred miles 
away. And the Philippines flank the China Sea, the life line 
between Tokyo and the stolen empire of the East Indies. 

IV. THE ATTACK ON JAPANESE SUPPLY AND INDUSTRY 

Destruction from the air of Japanese war plants and ship- 
yards began a year after the aerial offensive against Germany 
was under way [June 15, 1944]. The delay in the strategic 
bombing of Japan resulted from the concentration of Ameri- 
can air power over Europe and the lack of bases in Asia 
close to Japan. Outer Pacific defenses of the Japanese Em- 
pire, in New Britain, the Marshall, Caroline, and Marianas 
Islands had been blasted by U. S. Navy carrier planes 
through late 1943 and early 1944. Yet the Japanese home- 
land had seen American bombers only once, on Doolittle's 
famous raid of April 18, 1942. 

For two and a half years after Pearl Harbor the greatest 

284 



damage to Japanese supply had been inflicted by American 
submarines. The "silent service," which operates in complete 
secrecy, penetrated the home waters of Japan and even took 
pictures of the mountain top of Fujiyama through their peri- 
scopes as they went about the stealthy business of cutting 
interior enemy supply lines. By September 1943, the late 
Frank Knox, Secretary of the Navy, estimated that Japan 
had lost one-third of her prewar merchant shipping, a total 
of more than 2,500,000 tons. By the summer of 1944, Ameri- 
can submarines had sunk a total of 687 Japanese vessels 
and damaged 115. In the most successful months they de- 
stroyed 130,000 tons. The Japanese were forced to convoy 
supply vessels even off their own coasts, and with the in- 
creasing loss of tankers and large vessels, they began to use 
barges and smaller boats along the China coast. This reduc- 
tion of ocean traffic, the only result our submarines could 
achieve in their war of attrition, did not, however, lessen 
Japanese war production. 

The destruction of supply at its sources was the mission 
of a new U. S. Army Air Force, the Twentieth, which had 
been secretly organized and equipped with giant new bomb- 
ers, B-29 Superfortresses. Under direct command of General 
Arnold in Washington, the Twentieth was the first global air 
force in history, an aerial battle fleet with bases in Asia, 
which could make any continent its theater of operations. 
The B-29, developed since 1939 from the B-17 and now put 
into mass production, had the greatest striking range of any 
bomber in the world. Able to fly round trips of thirty-six 
hundred miles, it was peculiarly suited to the specialized 
mission of bombing Japan from remote Chinese bases. 
Through the winter and spring of 1943-44 several hundred 
thousand Chinese laborers built airfields for the B-29. Sup- 
plies, gasoline, bombs, and planes were flown in over the 
difficult Himalaya Hump from India. The Superfortress was 
half again as big as the Flying Fortress, with a wing span of 
half a city block, a speed of over three hundred miles an 
hour, heavy armor and guns, and a potential bomb load 
greater over comparable ranges than the British Lancaster's 
eight tons. 

The first force of these planes to strike at Japan came out 

285 



of the west on a night raid [June 15-16, 1944] and hurled 
their bombs down on the Yawata steel works, located in 
Kyushu, the southernmost of Japan's main islands. Four 
planes were lost, two in accidents, one to antiaircraft fire, 
and another for unknown reasons. Three weeks went by be- 
fore the second raid [July 7-8, 1944] , suggesting the difficul- 
ties of supplying Chinese air bases. Then the B-29s returned 
to Japan, bombing the Yawata steel works again, and the 
naval base at Sasebo. On this night raid there were no losses. 
The range of bombing operations extended to Japanese 
war industries situated on the Asiatic mainlaid. B-29s struck 
targets at Anshan in Manchuria, and Tangku, the port for 
Tientsin in occupied China. This was the first daylight raid 
by Superfortresses, and two planes were lost [July 29, 
1944]. On their fourth operation [August 11, 1944], two 
forces of B-29s, one flying from a Chinese base, the other 
from Southeast Asia, bombed widely separated Japanese in- 
dustrial targets with incendiaries. They struck the Nagasaki 
area of Kyushu in the north, and in the south the large 
Pladju oil refinery at Palembang, Sumatra. Three planes 
failed to return; another came down in friendly territory. 
These four operations were the experimental beginning of 
the strategic bombing offensive against Japanese war indus- 
tries all over Asia, a growing offensive carried on by mightier 
war planes than Germany had ever seen. 



32. THE FIRST BLOWS IN ITALY 

In the great offensive against Germany, it was logical for 
the Allies to strike their first blows from Italy, where British 
and American armies had fought hard all through the winter 
of 1944. Italy was never a "side show." The Mediterranean 
was the only European theater in which American and Brit- 
ish troops engaged the enemy before the spring of 1944. 
Here some fifteen or more Allied divisions pinned down an 
enemy force estimated at twenty-five divisions, of which five 
contained the Allied beachhead at Anzio and twelve the 
southern front. The fighting in Italy was as tough as any- 
where else in the world, for it fell largely to the infantry, 

286 



slugging their way through fortified enemy lines and storm- 
ing or bypassing snow-topped mountains. Allied progress in 
southern Italy had been slow because the mountainous ter- 
rain protected the enemy and made his delaying actions 
count heavily. 

The Spring Drive 

After the assaults on Cassino failed and the Anzio beach- 
head troops were checked in the winter and early spring of 
1944, the Allied forces regrouped for their part in the sum- 
mer offensive [March 26, 1944]. The Fifth Army, including 
the U. S. 85th, 88th, and 36th Infantry Divisions, trans- 
ferred to the west coast along the Tyrrhenian Sea, the Anzio 
garrison was reinforced, and the British Eighth Army, with 
French and Polish units, came over from the Adriatic to 
take the place of the Fifth around Cassino. With their forces 
concentrated in the west and center, the Allies could exert 
the strongest pressure toward Rome. 

Marshal Albert Kesselring also regrouped his divisions in 
preparation for the expected Allied offensive. His defenses 
consisted of two mountain barriers, strongly fortified: the 
Gustav Line along the Garigliano and Rapido rivers, with 
Cassino as the main bastion; and behind it the so-called 
Hitler Line from Terracina to Aquino. The Germans flooded 
the Pontine Marshes [May 3, 1944] which lay between the 
Allied forces on the Anzio and Cassino fronts; and British 
fliers, to protect their flank on the Adriatic Sea, blasted the 
dam of the Pescara River [May 5, 1944]. The Mediterra- 
nean Allied Air Force, flying 21,000 sorties through the 
month of April, wrecked all the enemy railroad yards be- 
low Florence. 

After heavy artillery and aerial preparation, the Eighth 
and Fifth Armies launched a spring drive to destroy the 
Nazi forces in Italy and to liberate Rome. [May 11, 1944]. 
Their plan, similar to the Anzio-Cassino pincers of the win- 
ter campaign, was to drive the enemy back against the Anzio 
beachhead, from which the reinforced garrison would break 
out to trap him below Rome. In the first week of fighting, 
the Allied forces broke the Gustav Line and advanced twelve 
miles to the Hitler Line. French troops under General Al- 

287 



phonse Juin pressed forward south [May 14-16, 1944] of 
the Liri River to Mount d'Oro and struck southwest to cap- 
ture Mount Chiavica. Polish troops, commanded by General 
Wladyslaw Anders, cut in behind the mountain towering 
over Cassino and joined British spearheads in the encircle- 
ment of the town [May 17, 1944]. Cassino was captured, 
with fifteen hundred prisoners. 

On the coast the Americans pushed forward from the Min- 
turno along the Gulf of Gaeta. They captured Formio [May 
18, 1944], and drove the Germans back over fifteen miles 
to Terracina, which fell [May 24, 1944] after a battle last- 
ing three days. In the first two weeks of the offensive U. S. 
II Corps of the Fifth Army, comprising the 85th and 88th 
Divisions, the first all-Selective-Service outfits to fight in 
Europe, advanced sixty miles. They turned the enemy's 
right wing, and compelled him to abandon his mountain 
strongholds in the interior. 

Liberation of Rome 

The Fifth Army opened the roads to Rome, the Appian 
Way and the Casilina Way, as it fought up the Tyrrhenian 
coast from Terracina to join the troops on the Anzio beach- 
head, commanded by Major General (now Lieutenant Gen- 
eral) Lucian K. Truscott, Jr., and crack the Nazi defenses 
in the Alban Hills. The Anzio garrison opened a drive on all 
sides of its perimeter while the Americans approached from 
the south [May 23, 1944]. There was bloody fighting at 
Cisterna, the strongpoint from which the German Fourteenth 
Army under General Mackensen had contained the beach- 
head. Cisterna was taken only after seven counterattacks 
made by Nazi tanks were repelled. Over one thousand Amer- 
ican field guns had laid down a deadly fire on Cisterna. 
With its fall the Anzio and southern forces joined hands near 
Borgo Grappa, south of Cisterna [May 25, 1944]. 

The German Tenth Army, withdrawing from the southern 
front, might now be cut off if the two strongpoints covering 
its escape, Velletri and Valmontone, could be taken quickly. 
The Fourteenth Army, falling back from Cisterna, clung to 
these positions, reinforced by the phoenix-hke Hermann 
Goering Division which had been routed in Tunisia, Sicily, 

288 



and at Salerno. Although a direct attack on Velletri failed 
[May 31, 1944], the town was nearly encircled when Ameri- 
can infantry cut it off from Valmontone and stormed Mount 
Peschio to the north. Fighting down this mountain and up 
Faete, both extinct volcanoes about three thousand feet 
high, the Americans broke through the German defenses and 
captured Velletri and Valmontone [June 2, 1944]. Although 
the enemy had not been cut off, the roads to Rome lay open. 
On the 275th day of the Italian campaign, the Fifth Army 
advanced twenty-two miles and captured the Eternal City, 
first Axis capital to fall [June 4, 1944]. 

Rome was yielded, its historic monuments saved by the 
speed of the Allied advance, as the Nazis retreated north 
without fighting for the city. They had suffered sixty thou- 
sand casualties since the Allied offensive began; over twenty 
thousand prisoners were taken and five divisions were badly 
cut up. Field Marshal Kesselring's Tenth and Fourteenth 
Armies, objective of the Battle of Italy, were not entirely 
destroyed, but they were in headlong retreat after incurring 
heavy losses. "One of Kesselring's two armies," said General 
Clark, "will never fight again." The Americans did not stop 
to celebrate their triumphal entry into Rome. All through a 
winter of grim fighting at Cassino and Anzio they had strug- 
gled to reach this city. Now they were in hot pursuit of the 
stubborn enemy. 

Allied Advance to the Arno 

Not since their retreat in the last days at Tunisia had the 
Nazis forces fallen back in such haste. Yet this time they 
maintained good order, fought persistent delaying actions, 
mined all the roads heavily, and reached the Gothic Line. 
This natural defensive barrier ran across Italy from Pisa to 
Rimini along the heights above the Arno River, about 150 
miles north of Rome. During all of June and July the Allied 
forces fought their way to the Arno, delayed by lengthening 
supply lines and dogged enemy resistance. The Germans 
lost heavily in supplies, weapons, and transport as they fell 
back under continuous attack by Allied planes. The Mediter- 
ranean Allied Air Force flew 50,800 sorties during the month 
of June, destroying 480 Axis planes and losing 374. 

289 



In its advances from Rome to the Arno, the Fifth Army 
made the most rapid progress along the Tyrrhenian coast to 
Leghorn and Pisa. At the outset they pressed forward at the 
rate of seven miles a day. But the roads were so thickly 
strewn with mines and demolitions were so thorough that the 
troops avoided them and traveled through the hills for 
greater speed. Meanwhile, a French amphibious force landed 
on the island of Elba and captured a German garrison of 
1,800 men [June 17-19, 1944]. The Fifth Army advanced 
to Cecina [July 2, 1944], where enemy resistance stiffened. 
American and French troops occupied Siena [July 3, 1944]. 
Then they pushed beyond Volterra, the mountain town 
guarding Leghorn fifteen miles away, and ran into the hard- 
est fight since the breakthrough below Rome [July 9, 1944]. 
Leghorn was a seaport strongly defended by the Germans. 
The Americans captured the city [July 19, 1944] by out- 
flanking it on the east and laying down heavy artillery fire 
from the surrounding heights. The day Leghorn fell, Polish 
troops on the Adriatic coast captured Ancona. These two 
seaports improved Allied supply when the heavy demolitions 
of the Germans were repaired three weeks later. As the enemy 
drew back from Leghorn across the Arno [July 23, 1944], 
American patrols fought their way into the southern part of 
Pisa, where a long duel [July 31-September 2, 1944] ensued 
between American and German heavy artillery, the latter 
commanding the city from the northern banks of the Arno. 

While the Fifth Army was moving forward one hundred 
miles along the Tyrrhenian coast [June 5-18, 1944], the 
Polish Corps on the Adriatic coast advanced fifty miles. The 
British Eighth Army in the center had the hardest time of 
all. Their advance was retarded by strong enemy positions 
in the hills of Umbria and Tuscany [June 19, 1944]. After 
capturing Perugia, ninety miles north of Rome, the British 
found the last third of the distance to Florence the slowest. 
They made repeated attacks [June 28-July 3, 1944] to pass 
both sides of Lake Trasimeno and finally broke through into 
Arezzo [July 16, 1944], the fall of which opened the way to 
Florence. The Germans gave up this city reluctantly [July 
29, 1944], defending it from hills to the south, in the streets, 
and across the Arno, where they left only one bridge stand- 
290 



ing. After British patrols entered Florence [August 4, 1944], 
the Eighth Army came up in force to outflank pockets of 
resistance in the northern half of the city [August 10, 1944]. 
The Germans fell back here, as from Pisa, to the Gothic 
Line. 

33. THE GREAT INVASION: OPERATION OVERLORD 

The great invasion of Western Europe, planned to liberate 
France, Belgium, and Holland, and finally to drive the Nazis 
back into Germany, came late in the spring of 1944. It was 
the supreme test of the combined arms of the United States 
and the British Empire, the largest and most dangerous 
military operation ever undertaken by their forces. Hitler 
boasted that all Europe was a Fascist fortress. His engineers 
claimed that the Atlantic coast was an impregnable wall, the 
beaches mined, the cliffs girded with artillery, and every 
landing place covered by batteries of guns emplaced in con- 
crete fortifications. 

In the face of defenses so formidable, millions of people 
throughout the world held their breath in fear or hope as the 
time for invasion approached. They remembered the last 
time an assault was made on this fortified coast, by a force 
of five thousand Canadian and British troops raiding Dieppe 
[August 19, 1942], when a few hours of fighting cost them 
3,350 casualties. Since then, nearly two years before, British 
and American troops had made four successful landings in 
the Mediterranean, on the coasts of North Africa and Sicily, 
at the beaches of Salerno and Anzio, each assault a perilous 
one but a triumph of training, supply, command, and cour- 
age. Nowhere in the Mediterranean, however, did the Nazis 
have such strong defenses as they had prepared along the 
Atlantic coast of Europe. Behind these defenses, from the 
Netherlands to the south of France, waited sixty or more 
enemy divisions, ready to concentrate against the Allied 
armies, which could land only a few regiments at a time, 
and drive them back into the sea. 

Strong as the Nazis appeared, they proved to be too weak 
to repulse the great invasion. Their ground forces were di- 
vided among three fronts, the largest number fighting against 

291 



Russia, a smaller group trying to hold Italy and the Balkans, 
and the rest standing guard over all of Western Europe. 
Everywhere they had lost control of the air and coastal 
waters. A year of strategic bombing had crippled the war 
industries of Germany and worn down the Luftwaffe. Two 
months of tactical bombing destroyed main railroads and 
bridges in the west of Europe and hindered the concentra- 
tion of enemy forces against the invading armies. 

Massed in the British Isles were two million or more 
troops from the Empire and the United States, all well 
trained and equipped. To supply them, over sixteen million 
tons of materiel were shipped from the United States to 
Britain in the year preceding the invasion, twice the total 
tonnage received by American forces in France during the 
last war. If the Allies could seize a beachhead in Western 
Europe, they would eventually overwhelm the enemy with 
superior numbers and fire power. The exact date for D-day 
no one knew except Allied high command, but everybody 
realized that upon the success of the invasion depended the 
defeat of Fascism in Europe. 

Massing the Troops Overseas 

In 1944 the United States was ready to enter what Secre- 
tary Stimson called [June 1, 1944] "the period of decisive 
action." For America it was the third year of war; for Ger- 
many, the fifth. Troops were now massed abroad in sufficient 
force, and with enough equipment, to hit the Nazis hard in 
Europe. There were 5,223,000 Americans stationed abroad 
or at sea; of this number, over 3,500,000 were soldiers, the 
rest sailors or marines, representing almost half the total 
manpower in each service. Protected supply lines to these 
forces, on duty in every continent and ocean of the world, 
stretched over 56,000 miles of land and water. In the United 
States, preparing to go overseas, the Army had 1,300,000 
men, the Navy, 900,000. The maximum fighting force of the 
United States at last was marshalled to engage the enemy. 

This vast force had been deployed in three phases accord- 
ing to a pattern designed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 
Washington. They planned the over-all size of the American 
Army, determined the equipment it required, and allocated 

292 



the shipping necessary to take men and supplies overseas. 
These plans were drawn up and continually revised to meet 
changing strategic needs. But there were three goals of grand 
strategy which never changed throughout the war, and they 
shaped the three phases in which the fighting power of the 
United States was deployed overseas. It was necessary first 
to hold the enemy, then to drive him back from the offen- 
sive to the defensive, and finally to take the offensive and 
defeat him. 

In the first phase, extending through 1942, men and sup- 
plies were hurriedly transported overseas to "plug the line" 
of defense which had to be held if the Axis was to be pre- 
vented from overrunning the Middle East and the Pacific. 
Supply lines were established to Australia and Africa, bases 
developed in the Pacific and Middle East, and the hard- 
pressed fronts in these theaters were reinforced. 

In the second phase, extending roughly from late in 1942 
through most of 1943, ground and air forces crossed the 
Atlantic and Pacific to crack the enemy's outer defenses. 
The Germans were driven back to Italy from Africa and 
Sicily, and Italy was knocked out of the war. The Japanese 
defenses were penetrated in the Solomon, Gilbert, and Mar- 
shall Islands. While combat divisions went abroad and into 
battle in both these phases, the bulk of the ground troops 
remained in the United States to finish their training. Hence 
the majority of men going overseas in 1942 and early in 1943 
belonged to the Army Air and Service Forces, which sta- 
tioned nearly half their personnel abroad. It was their mis- 
sion to prepare the way for ground troops and to launch the 
offensive from the air. By the middle of 1943 almost one and 
a half million Americans were engaged in these tasks over- 
seas. 

They were joined in the following twelve months by two 
million men, the majority of whom were ground troops, pre- 
pared to enter the final phase of decisive battle in Europe. 
Through the winter and spring of 1944, great convoys of 
troops and supplies crossed the Atlantic to British ports. In 
May, when preparations for the invasion of France reached 
the climax, the Army Service Forces moved nearly four mil- 

293 



lion tons of cargo overseas, twice the total shipped abroad 
during the same month of the preceding year. To mount 
the invasion of Europe, American factories and shipyards 
speeded up their production through the winter and spring 
of 1944. In November 1943, landing craft were given top 
priority, but their construction lagged behind schedule until 
an all-out effort in the last two months before D-day met the 
need for tens of thousands of ships to launch the invasion. 
Heavy artillery for follow-up fire power was given priority 
in April and production of such weapons increased rapidly 
as American troops landed in France. 

The American divisions in England, including some which 
had arrived in 1942 and others which had not arrived until 
1944, rehearsed the invasion for months, first in the interior 
of the country and then along the coasts. They learned the 
hundreds of special tasks involved in an assault on a hostile, 
fortified coast. They perfected their communications, supply, 
and battle tactics, made "dry runs" and "wet runs," the lat- 
ter in full cooperation with British and American naval 
forces, each man thinking it was the actual invasion. In the 
course of all these maneuvers the troops assigned to the in- 
vasion acquired confidence in themselves, their outfits, and 
their weapons. When they moved at last into the staging 
areas for embarkation, their morale was invincible. 

I. ALLIED LANDINGS IN NORMANDY 

D-day came on Tuesday, June 6, 1944. Allied battleships 
and cruisers opened fire on the northern coast of Normandy, 
at 0630. H-hour was at 0730. The landing of troops, orig- 
inally scheduled for Monday, had been postponed at the last 
moment, because the worst June gales in forty years swept 
over the Channel. Thousands of ships loaded with men and 
guns waited in English ports for General Eisenhower's order 
to start the invasion. Before the great armada of landing 
ships reached the French coast in the early morning dark- 
ness of D-day, the enemy was under furious attack. From 
midnight the tactical air forces swept down on his defenses 
with a tornado of bombs, and thousands of airborne troops 
landed behind his lines. 

294 



Air Operations 

Over eleven thousand Allied aircraft of all types covered 
the invading armies. From D-day to D plus 4 [June 6-10, 
1944] they flew 32,500 sorties and dropped 27,000 tons of 
bombs. Enemy fighter planes offered little resistance, for the 
prolonged aerial offensive against Germany had almost 
driven them from the skies. In the first forty-eight hours of 
the invasion the Allied air forces shot down 176 enemy 
planes and lost 289, mostly to antiaircraft fire. Tactical 
bombing which preceded D-day undermined the enemy's 
coastal defenses and destroyed railroads and bridges across 
the Seine, making it difficult for the Germans to move troops 
and supplies in northern France. Not until D-day, however, 
was the Normandy coast singled out for the heaviest bomb- 
ing. Consequently, the enemy, unable to guess where or at 
how many scattered points the Allied forces would land, 
suffered a tactical surprise. 

On the eve of D-day, at midnight, one thousand British 
heavy bombers began to pound the French coast. At day- 
light an equal force of American bombers took over this 
mission. Half an hour before the landings, American medium 
and dive bombers concentrated on the Normandy coast. 
Because of stormy weather, which reduced the ceiling to one 
thousand feet, the Marauders went in "on the deck" and 
struck their targets from only nine hundred feet. 

The skies were clouded with planes all the way from Eng- 
land to inland France. As the landing boats crossed the 
Channel in the dark hours of D-day, swarms of P-38 Light- 
nings covered them, and P-47 Thunderbolts fiew ahead 
to strafe the beaches. In France medium and light bombers 
struck at railroads, motor roads, and supply dumps as far 
east as the Pari.s-Orleans gap between the rivers Seine and 
Loire. These aerial operations, intricately contrived and 
precisely executed, assured the Allied assault forces of good 
air cover. 

The first troops to land in Normandy \Jtme 6, 1944] were 
airborne. They crossed the enemy coast six minutes after 
midnight and parachuted to earth ten minutes later. In four 
hours the U. S. IX Troop Carrier Command, cooperating 

295 



with the RAF, landed three divisions behind the German 
coastal defenses. Mosquito bombers had first neutralized 
inland antiaircraft batteries; then Pathfinder planes had 
marked the drop zones with flares. Paratroopers followed, 
seizing fields and setting up their own antiaircraft guns. 
Finally came the transport planes and gliders with airborne 
infantry. It was the largest and most efficient airborne opera- 
tion in five years of war. The Allied forces landed exactly as 
planned and plane losses ran to less than three per cent of 
those suffered by the Germans in Crete. 

The primary mission of these airborne units was to dis- 
organize the enemy rear and establish the east and west 
sides of a perimeter to be formed by ground troops when 
they landed at the beachheads. In these tasks they were suc- 
cessful and soon made contact with the assault forces driving 
forward from the beaches to meet them. Landing nine miles 
inland near Caen, the British 6th Airborne Division seized 
the bridges across the Orne River and became the advance 
guard of the British Second Army on the eastern flank of 
the Allied beachheads. The American 82d and 101st Air- 
borne Divisions covered the central (Omaha) and western 
(Utah) beachheads established by the American First Army. 
The 82d, dropped near Ste. Mere figlise to protect the right 
flank, assisted the landing of the 4th Infantry Division by 
overwhelming German batteries which enfiladed the cause- 
ways over marshes which had to be crossed by these troops. 
The 101st was dropped farther east and later joined in link- 
ing at Carentan the central and western beachheads, divided 
by the Vire River. 

Winning the Beachheads 

The Allied armies crossed the English Chanel in an im- 
mense fleet of some four thousand boats. They were con- 
voyed by eight hundred warships, two-thirds of them Brit- 
ish, divided into two task forces. Mine sweepers cleared 
enemy coastal waters and marked out channels with buoys 
for the landing craft to follow. Over one hundred German 
submarines and flotillas of "E" torpedo boats were waiting 
in the Bay of Biscay, but none penetrated the Allied naval 
escort which sealed off one hundred miles of water across 

296 



the English Channel. At 0630, while more than one thousand 
American bombers were hurling down explosives on the Nor- 
mandy coast, the na7al bombardment began. Battleships, 
the American Texas, Arkansas, and Nevada, the British 
Warspite, Nelson, and Rodney, added their heavy fire to the 
barrage laid down for half an hour by cruisers and destroy- 
ers running close inshore. From midnight the air forces had 
dropped over ten thousand tons of bombs, and the warships 
fired over two thousand tons of shells. Behind this screen of 
fire the landing craft swarmed toward the beaches. As troops 
waded and climbed ashore, at 0730, both planes and war- 
ships shifted their fire to targets picked out by the assault 
forces. 

The invaders landed on five beaches along a sixty-mile 
stretch of the Cotentin Peninsula, from east of Caen toward 
Montebourg in the west [June 6, 1944]. The British Second 
Army, landing in the eastern sector of the Allied beachhead, 
met little opposition at first. On the right the Canadian 3d 
Division penetrated seven miles inland and captured Bayeux 
[June 7 , 1944] to cut the lateral road running east to Caen. 
On the left the British 6th Airborne Division reinforced by 
glider-borne tanks, clung to the bridges until the Germans 
swept them back. Marshal Rommel sent the 21st Panzer 
Division against them in an effort to roll up the Allied 
beachhead. Falling back from Caen, which was cut off from 
the beaches by an enemy roadblock at Douvres, the advance 
British elements joined their 7th Armored and 50th Infantry 
Divisions to halt the German tanks between Caen and Bay- 
eux. In the course of four days [June 7-11, 1944] with as- 
sistance from the Canadians and the support of cruisers 
offshore and planes overhead, the Second Army drove inland 
as far as Tilly and joined its beachheads. 

The American First Army established the central and 
western beachheads [June 6, 1944] on either side of the 
Vire River. To the west, on Utah Beach, VTI Corps under 
Major General (now Lieutenant General) J. Lawton Collins, 
with the 4th Infantry Division in the vanguard, encountered 
light resistance and pushed inland over the marshes toward 
Carentan to make contact with the 82d Airborne Division. 
The fiercest struggle of the invasion was on the eastern side 

297 



of the Vire River at the central beachhead. Here on Omaha 
Beach the V Corps under Major General (now Lieutenant 
General) Leonard T. Gerow stormed ashore with the 1st and 
29th Infantry Divisions in the lead. Mines and underwater 
obstacles wrecked many landing craft. The troops who got 
ashore could advance only one hundred yards in several 
hours, for enemy batteries on the cliffs, secure from small 
naval guns, made a death trap of the beach until they were 
wiped out by bombers and a rain of shells from battleships 
offshore. The remaining elements of the 1st and 29th Divi- 
sions got ashore in the afternoon and seized the beachhead 
from a reinforced enemy division. "Only by guts, valor and 
extreme bravery," observed General Bradley, ''were we able 
to make the landing a success." 

From their beachheads on either side of the Vire River, 
the U. S. V and VII Corps fought inland along the marshes, 
captured Isigny, and after a battle lasting four days [June 
8-12, 1944], joined their lines on high ground at Carentan. 
The 101st Airborne Division entered the town under a smoke 
screen and with strong artillery support. The capture of 
Carentan cut one of the two railroads running across Nor- 
mandy to the port of Cherbourg and provided dry ground on 
which local air strips were soon established. Although a few 
fighter planes flying from an emergency field had partici- 
pated in the battle the third day after invasion, it was not 
until D plus 9 that the fighters had enough local strips to 
operate in large numbers. 

The joining of the Allied beachheads for eighty miles along 
the Normandy coast, and the penetration to a depth of 
twenty miles at Bayeux, the southernmost point, marked the 
end of the first two phases of the invasion. The landings were 
everywhere successful, although bitterly contested, and in 
the first five days of the invasion sixteen Allied divisions 
stormed ashore to meet the fourteen enemy divisions con- 
centrated under General Rommel. Pushing inland and fan- 
ning out along the coast, they established a beachhead for 
the steady flow of men and supplies into the combat area. 

Stormy weather twice interrupted the race to build up the 
Allied forces, even suspending seaborne reinforcements at 
one tirrie. Not until they won the deepwater port of Cher- 



bourg, first major objective of the invasion, did the Allies 
hope to get enough troops and supplies ashore to overwhelm 
the enemy. Yet, when the weather was clear, they continued 
to land men so rapidly on the beaches, averaging 37,500 a 
day and reaching a total strength of one million by D plus 
20, that the fourteen enemy divisions opposing them at first 
could not long hold their ground. From the Russians came 
full recognition of the victorious start of the Allied invasion. 
"The history of wars," said Marshal Stalin [June 13, 1944], 
"does not know any such undertaking so broad in conception 
and so grandiose in its scale and so masterly in execution." 

The Robot-Bomb Attack 

Shortly after Allied forces landed in Normandy, the Nazis 
attacked southern England [June 15, 1944] with a "secret 
weapon" by which Hitler hoped to demoralize the civilian 
population and to postpone defeat. It was the robot or "buzz 
bomb." A miniature plane, with a wingspread of sixteen feet, 
jet-propelled, it was gyroscopically balanced, guided by a 
magnetic compass, and flew a level course. When its fuel 
was gone, the plane plunged to earth with a ton of high ex- 
plosives. Because of great flying speed, four hundred miles 
an hour, only the newest planes, Tempests, Spitfires, and 
Mustangs, could overtake it. Most of the robots were 
launched in salvos from heavily camouflaged ramps along 
the Channel coast above Calais. Since it was impossible to 
aim the robots at a specific military target, a large city like 
London was their only effective destination. 

This aerial barrage lasted for eighty days [June 15-Sep- 
tember 1, 1944]. At its height, on cloudy days in June and 
July, the Nazis fired two hundred robots every twenty-four 
hours, but the bombs generally came spasmodically, day or 
night. At first casualties ran high: up to the beginning of 
September, 5,479 people were killed, chiefly in London, and 
15,934 were wounded. A million people, one-fourth of whom 
were mothers with children, were evacuated from London 
to avoid higher casualties. The greatest damage was done to 
buildings. Windows were shattered at a considerable dis- 
tance by the blast of the bombs, and flying glass cut many 
people. A large number of schools and hospitals were de- 

299 



stroyed and altogether over a million homes suffered dam- 
age; the majority of them were in London. 

The British were well prepared for this second Battle of 
London, so much more terrifying in its way than the experi- 
ence of 1940 because the mechanical bombs struck at ran- 
dom, without human control, and destroyed everything in 
the immediate radius of their blast. Over a year before the 
attack began, British secret agents had reported to the Com- 
bined Chiefs of Staff that the Nazis were experimenting with 
a mysterious weapon, which was soon discovered by aerial 
reconnaissance [May 1943] to be some sort of rocket or 
flying bomb. When the Nazis built one hundred concrete 
launching stations along the French coast [November 
1943], Allied planes completely destroyed them during a 
winter of intensive bombing. So great was the ruin that in 
March 1944, the Nazis set to work, building entirely new 
ramps, simpler, better camouflaged, with hidden storage de- 
pots. On these and previous sites, Allied bombers dropped 
a total of 100,000 tons of bombs, losing nearly 450 aircraft 
in the heavy flak which was encountered on their low bomb- 
ing runs. 

When, nevertheless, the robot attack began, the British 
improvised new air-raid defenses to meet it. The barrage 
balloons guarding London, increased to two thousand and 
fitted with extra cables, brought down almost fifteen per 
cent of the bombs reaching the outskirts of the city. In two 
days of mid-July over one thousand antiaircraft guns were 
moved from London and set up along the coast, where a 
clear view over the sea enabled the gunners finally to shoot 
down nearly three-quarters of the bombs flying over their 
stations. Twenty American antiaircraft batteries joined the 
British "shooting gallery" with 350 guns. Fighter pilots, 
both British and American, aided by radio-telephone spot- 
ters during the day and guided by a twenty-cent range finder 
at night, shot down nineteen hundred bombs. These com- 
bined defenses became so effective that nine out of every ten 
robots fired late in August 1944 were stopped and only one 
reached London. Altogether, about 8,000 V-ls (Vengeance 
Weapon One) were launched, of which 2,300 exploded in the 
English capital, where most of the fatal casualties occurred. 

300 



The V-2 Weapon 

On September 8, 1944, the day after it was officially an- 
nounced that the last V-1 robot bomb fell in England, the 
Germans introduced a new type of "vengeance weapon," the 
V-2. This was a stratosphere rocket with a warhead of about 
the same weight as the V-1 and a body 45 feet in length. 
Fired at an almost vertical position from bases on the Con- 
tinent, these rockets reached tremendous altitudes and came 
to earth at a speed greater than that of sound. Their deep 
penetration before detonation limited the area of blast, but 
they were almost as deadly as the V-1. A total of 1,050 V-2 
rockets reached England between September 8, 1944 and 
April 25, 1945, killing 2,754 persons and seriously injuring 
6,523. Unlike the V-1 weapon, there was no immediate de- 
fense against the V-2 rocket. Its speed rendered all forms of 
fighter plane and antiaircraft interception impossible. The 
V-2 did not affect the course of the war, but it pointed to 
frightening developments in the future. 

II. THE BATTLE OF NORMANDY 

The battle for Normandy opened with a swift American 
drive to secure the port of Cherbourg. The Cotentin Penin- 
sula, at the northern end of which the port is situated, ex- 
tends northward into the English Channel at almost a right 
angle to the mainland of France. In the third phase of the 
invasion, the U.S. VII Corps cut the peninsula in half [June 
18, 1944], isolating Cherbourg, by a sweep to the coast op- 
posite their beachhead. In the fourth phase, Cherbourg 
was captured [June 27, 1944]. 

Against light resistance the 82d Airborne and 9th Infantry 
Divisions pressed westward to the sea, each moving over a 
secondary road through rolling country covered with apple 
orchards. One column advanced from St. Jacques, cleaning 
out snipers, and reached the coast at Carteret, the other 
column moving from St. Sauveur with tanks, cut the last 
road to Cherbourg and fanned south and west along the 
coast to Portbail [June 18, 1944], establishing a corridor 
seven miles wide which extended from coast to coast. The 
U.S. VII Corps swung north to reduce the four enemy divi- 

301 



sions believed to be cut off in the Cherbourg area and to 
win the port. 

Capture of Cherbourg 

On the left, troops advanced toward Cap de la Hague 
[June 19-20, 1944] to seal off all evacuation points; others, 
on the right, moved north on Pointe de Barfieur, and in the 
center a column swung north directly on Cherbourg. Monte- 
bourg, an enemy strongpoint on the right-rear, which had 
held out under persistent attacks for ten days [June 9-19, 
1944] was bypassed. In the face of the American advance, 
the Germ.ans withdrew into the strong fortifications of Cher- 
bourg [June 21, 1944], protected on its overland approaches 
by a semicircle of wooded ridges studded with such forts 
as Montague du Roule, which extended several stories under- 
ground and was armed with heavy guns. Although the enemy 
had no chance of escape by land, he was apparently resolved 
to endure a siege which would delay the conquest of Nor- 
mandy by denying the Allies a port to reinforce and supply 
their armies. 

The U.S. 4th, 9th, and 79th Infantry Divisions under Gen- 
eral Collins launched the direct attack on Cherbourg [June 
22, 1944]. After a concentration of one thousand bombers 
and a half-hour of artillery preparation, the infantry ad- 
vanced under a rolling barrage. They overran some forts, 
bypassed others, and next day entered the outskirts of Cher- 
bourg from the southeast. The enemy was putting up his 
strongest resistance inside the city. In the street fighting 
that followed, the infantry reduced pillboxes and machine- 
gun nests, while the forts above the city were subjected to 
the fire of heavy artillery, battleships, and medium bombers 
diving in waves on their targets. Fort du Roule was cap- 
tured by our assault troops, then lost to an enemy counter- 
attack at night, and finally recaptured the next day [June 
25, 1944]. On the left flank, troops advanced two miles 
north, bypassing the fort at Octeville, and turned east on 
the Cherbourg naval base, which surrendered while street 
fighting still went on in the city. On the right, troops by- 
passed the Maupertus airfield and swung west into the heart 
of Cherbourg. The German garrison surrendered [June 27, 

302 



1944] to infantry after the Air Force had dropped 8,200 
tons of bombs on the area in one week. Organized resistance 
on the peninsula did not end however, until the last enemy 
pockets on Cap de la Hague were cleaned up. Altogether 
some forty thousand prisoners had been taken by the Allied 
•forces since D-day \July 4, 1944] ; the majority were cap- 
tured at Cherbourg. 

The ruined port of Cherbourg was an example, like Naples 
and Leghorn, of the excellence of German demolitions. What 
the Nazis could not hold, they destroyed. The harbor and 
wharves were heavily mined, all the cranes blown up, and 
the breakwaters damaged; as a result, American engineers 
could not reclaim Cherbourg until August. During all this 
time, despite the lack of a natural deepwat^r harbor and in 
the teeth of strong offshore gales. Allied reinforcements and 
supplies streamed into Normandy through an artificial port. 

Within the first two weeks of the invasion Allied naval 
engineers had established two artificial harbors in the Bale 
de la Seine with a total capacity larger than the port of 
Cherbourg. One of these harbors, in the exposed water of 
the American beachhead near St. Laurent-sur-Mer, was prac- 
tically destroyed by a gale which blew across the bay for 
three days [June 19-22, 1944] ; but the other harbor, near 
the British beachhead of Arromanches, weathered the storm. 
Each harbor consisted of an outer roadstead, where ocean- 
going vessels anchored in the lee of a floating breakwater, 
and an inner roadstead, where a fixed breakwater of sub- 
merged concrete caissons protected the piers at which smaller 
craft unloaded. More than sixty blockships — over 300,000 
tons of shipping — had been scuttled offshore to make a tem- 
porary breakwater three days after the invasion began. Then 
150 concrete caissons were flooded and sunk 1,500 yards 
from the beaches to secure a permanent breakwater, and 
seaward of these caissons were anchored steel floats to serve 
as an additional buffer against tides and storms. Over the 
calm waters inside the caissons some ten miles of steel piers 
ran to shore, carrying all the tanks, trucks, guns, munitions, 
and men racing to build up the Allied forces. 

Such a miracle of engineering was not hastily improvised. 
It had been conceived in London in June 1943, and through 

303 



the following winter hundreds of caissons, floats, and piers 
had been secretly built in British shipyards. Instead of open- 
ing the invasion by storming a strongly fortified French port, 
at a terrible cost in lives, the Allied navies towed their own 
port facilities across the Channel and set them up in the Baie 
de la Seine. 

Through this harbor one million British and American 
troops had landed in Normandy by the time the port of 
Cherbourg was captured [June 26, 1944]. In the weeks that 
followed they were supplied with more than enough equip- 
ment, landed at the artificial port, to compensate for the 
loss of 3,000 planes, 900 tanks, 1,750 trucks, 1,500 mortars, 
2,400 automatic rifles, and 83,000 miles of field wire, between 
D-day and the ihd of August. Never before had such large 
armies, with all the heavy guns, tanks, and motorized equip- 
ment of modern war, invaded a hostile country without seiz- 
ing large ports. The amazing rate at which stores were ac- 
cumulated in Normandy was a triumph of supply. 

Americans were prepared for the cost of invasion to be 
high. During the first two weeks of fighting in Normandy 
[June 6-20, 1944] Allied casualties were 40,549; and of 
these three-fifths were Americans, since Americans had strug- 
gled for the central beachhead and made the drive on Cher- 
bourg. The total figures, issued by General Bradley's head- 
quarters, showed that 3,082 Americans were killed, 13,121 
wounded, and 7,959 missing. 

Fall of Caen 

In the next phase of the invasion the British Second Army, 
under Lieutenant General Sir Miles C. Dempsey, tried twice 
to break out of Normandy at the eastern end of the Allied 
beachheads, where Caen was the hinge of the enemy lines. 
Had they succeeded here in turning the enemy right flank, 
they would have divided the German Seventh Army in Nor- 
many from the Fifteenth Army guarding the northern Chan- 
nel ports and robot-bomb platforms along the Flanders coast. 
To avoid such a strategic catastrophe, threatening to force 
retreat on both the main German armies in France, the enemy 
concentrated the main weight of his armor and reserves 
throughout the Battle of Normady against the British around 

304 



Caen. The Second Army captured this inland port, then 
pinned the enemy down and consumed his tanks and men 
under the relentless pressure of almost continuous battle. 

The British opened their attack on Caen [June 25, 1944] 
without waiting for the Americans to finish the reduction of 
Cherbourg. As the Second Army crossed the Odon River 
[June 28, 1944] in a flanking movement southward, it ran 
into the strongest opposition which the enemy had thus far 
put up in Normandy. In three days and nights German tanks 
made twenty-four counterattacks, but always in detail and 
never in sufficient force to throw the British back. Worn 
down by the loss of over two hundred tanks, the enemy 
could carry out only feeble sallies in which two companies 
of infantry and ten or twenty tanks took part. 

Because they were short of reinforcements, the Germans 
wasted their mobile reserves of armor in small units. So great 
was the damage which Allied bombing had inflicted on their 
transport in France that a division required two weeks to 
reach the Normandy front from Holland, detouring as far 
east as Alsace-Lorraine. Allied fighter planes denied the 
enemy the use of roads by day, and bombers worked havoc 
on his railway yards at night. 

After the British were halted at the Odon, they shifted to 
the north to attack Caen. The new drive began with a con- 
centration of heavy bombers, tactics which became charac- 
teristic of the Allied offensive in Normandy. RAF planes 
pounded the Caen area [July 7, 1944]W\ih 2,300 tons of 
bombs, and cruisers offshore joined in the heavy artillery in 
laying down a barrage of fire. Then the Canadians drove 
east down the Bayeux road and the British south along the 
Caen Canal, converging on the town and compelling the 
enemy to withdraw across the Orne River into the southern 
end of Caen [July 9, 1944]. Here the Germans clung to the 
east bank of the river and sustained their flanks with per- 
sistent counterattacks. 

The British made a second attempt to break out of Nor- 
mandy ten days later when they resumed the offensive and 
struck southeast above Caen against the enemy line along 
the Orne. The attack was launched by 2,200 planes dropping 
7,000 tons of bombs, followed by 600 B-24s with 500 tons, 

305 



a concentration of explosives so heavy that the enemy was 
dazed. The Second Army, with tanks massed in the center 
and infantry on both flanks, pushed forward from their 
bridgehead on the east bank of the Orne, cleared the enemy 
from Caen, swept four miles beyond, and took 1,250 pris- 
oners, all in a hard day's fighting. Heavy rains had turned 
the land into a sea of mud. Then the tanks ran into a barrier 
of antitank guns, supported by light and heavy artillery in 
great depth, and the drive bogged down in the center [July 
19, 1944]. The British fought on, pushing their infantry for- 
ward on the flanks; and although they failed to achieve a 
breakthrough, they wore down the enemy reserves. It was 
estimated that the Germans had by now brought a total of 
300,000 troops, from twenty to twenty-five divisions, into 
Normandy. Their casualties since D-day, reported General 
Montgomery [July 19, 1944], had reached 156,000, of 
which 60,000 were prisoners of war. To this toll Americans 
contributed their share in the heavy fighting which went on 
in the central and western sectors of Normandy. 

Capture of St. Ld 

The British were pinning down enemy strength around 
the Caen hinge, in the fifth phase of the invasion; in the 
next, the Allied offensive was transferred to the American 
center. Here the First Army attempted to divide the Ger- 
man forces in Normandy by piercing their lines at St. L6. 
This offensive developed with the expansion southward of 
the American corridor across the Cotentin Peninsula. The 
movement threatened to outflank St. L6 by a drive down the 
coast beyond La Haye du Puits. 

In the first stage [July 1-3, 1944], following the capture 
of Cherbourg, the American First Army pivoted south and 
built up a new front from which to conquer Normandy. The 
VIII and XIX Corps, landing to hold and reinforce the 
Cotentin corridor, opened the offensive on a 35-mile front 
from east of Carentan to the west coast of the peninsula. 
The VIII Corps on the right, advancing in heavy rains, 
drove south [July 3, 1944] against the junction town of 
La Haye du Puits and soon captured the surrounding hills. 
After a bitter but inconclusive struggle for thirty-six hours 

306 



in Haye, the town was enveloped from east and west [July 6, 
1944] by columns which had succeeded in getting to the 
road below it. Three days later all resistance was crushed. 

On the left, southeast of Carentan, the XIX Corps, mean- 
while, attacked toward St. L6 [July 7, 1944], crossing the 
Vire River under an artillery barrage, and closing in on the 
town from the north. The V Corps captured Hill 192 [July 
11, 1944] commanding the road from St. L6 to Bayeux. 
While the. Americans in the center fought without pause to 
reduce the enemy defenses around St. L6, the troops on the 
right moved down the Coutances road [July 16, 1944] from 
La Haye to Lessay and Periers in an advance which threat- 
ened to outflank St. L6. This vital railroad center was finally 
captured [July 18, 1944] after two weeks of bloody fighting, 
by the 29th Division. The fall of St. L6 unhinged the entire 
western flank of the German line and unlocked the gateway 
to the south and east through which the Americans, with 
freedom to maneuver, broke out of Normandy. 

Up to this point the battle for Normandy had been a sav- 
age fight. The country was broken up into hedgerows, from 
three to five feet high, covered by dense thickets which af- 
forded natural protection to enemy snipers, machine-gun and 
mortar posts. At every critical point the enemy had set up 
a maze of defenses, often extending over four hundred yards 
in depth. The hedgerows, according to a Virginia infantry- 
man, were "horse-high, bull-strong, and hog-tight." Artillery 
could not reduce them. The infantry had to outflank each 
field and work slowly forward, taking hedgerow after hedge- 
row with heavy casualties. 

During this period [June 20-July 20, 1944], from the as- 
sault on Cherbourg to the capture of St. L6, American losses 
mounted higher than in the earlier phases of the invasion. 
In one month, 7,944 Americans were killed, and 39,549 
wounded. But the Allies drove the enemy halfway out of 
Normandy and won a bridgehead large enough to serve as a 
springboard for a great plunge by American tanks. 

The American Breakthrough 

The battle for Normandy was won, in the seventh phase 
of the Allied invasion, by armored divisions of the American 

307 



Third Army which broke through the German left flank at 
Avranches, burst into Brittany, swung northeast on the 
Seine, and outflanked Paris from the south. This spectacular 
demonstration of the speed and power of American armor 
could be compared only to the German breakthrough of 
1940 in France. The strategic consequences of the two drives 
were of equal importance, for while the German dash to the 
Channel divided the British and French forces, the American 
breakthrough led to the separation of two German armies, 
and their withdrawal into Germany. The Nazi thrust had led 
to the downfall of France; the Allied success opened the way 
to her liberation. 

The decisive turn of events was not the work of the Amer- 
ican Third Army alone. Their breakthrough was the spark 
which touched off the explosion ; but three other Allied armies 
turned the initial breakthrough into complete disaster for the 
enemy. Two other Allied armies cooperated with the Third 
to crush the German Seventh Army in Normandy. The enemy 
left flank was enveloped by the American First Army, while 
his right was pinned down by the British Second. The latter, 
at the Caen hinge, acted as a pivot upon which the Ameri- 
cans wheeled around the enemy rear. 

The last phase of the Allied offensive in Normandy opened 
with assaults [July 25, 1944] on both flanks of the German 
Seventh Army. After heavy air and artillery preparation, the 
British attacked the enemy's right flank before dawn on a 
four-mile front astride the Caen-Falaise road. Some ground 
was won, but part of it was soon lost again under a strong 
enemy counterattack, for on this flank the Germans were 
reported to have massed six panzer divisions. To hold them 
there was the mission of the British. 

Against the German left flank, bolstered at the start by 
only two panzer divisions, the American First Army mounted 
the main attack on a six-mile front from St. L6 to Periers. 
Before the assault, 1,575 heavy bombers of the Eighth Air 
Force flew in low and during one hour unloaded 3,400 tons of 
bombs; 1,000 medium and light bombers of the Ninth Air 
Force followed, dropping 1,000 tons of bombs. The hedge- 
rows and ditches of the bocage country were blasted away. 
Then, under a rolling artillery barrage, the 1st, 4th, 9th, and 

308 



30th Infantry Divisions surged forward two miles [July 26, 
1944] and pressed south toward Coutances against the Ger- 
man flank anchored on the coast. 

Inland, American armor suddenly entered the battle from 
the east. Four divisions of tanks sliced like a knife west and 
south through the enemy lines. The 4th Armored Division 
struck west and captured Coutances [July 28, 1944], cutting 
the enemy coastal line, then swung southeast and joined the 
1st Infantry, 2d Armored, and 4th Infantry Divisions to en- 
velop large numbers of the enemy in retreat [July 29, 1944]. 
Finding the German rear badly disorganized, the 4th Ar- 
mored broke through its defenses near St.-Denis-le-Gast and 
raced twelve miles south to Avranches, where Normandy and 
Brittany meet [July 30, 1944]. The 6th Armored Division 
swept down the coast as far as Granville and the 1st Infantry 
Division came up to Brecy [July 31, 1944], east of Avran- 
ches, expanding the breakthrough salient. 

The American tanks, striking like forked lightning, first at 
the enemy flank, then deep into his rear, sent the Germans 
reeling back. As they patched their lines with reinforcements 
from the Caen front, the British attacked southward [July 
31, 1944] and cut the lateral road to Avranches. The Ger- 
mans improvised counterattacks on the American salient and 
recaptured some minor points, but failed to halt the motor- 
ized infantry in its onward rush to consolidate the positions 
staked out by tanks. In eight days of continuous fighting the 
Americans had advanced thirty-five miles, captured 18,587 
prisoners, disrupted five enemy divisions, and turned the en- 
tire German left flank. 

As American armor poured through the funnel at Av- 
ranches to exploit its breakthrough, the Battle of Normandy 
became the Battle for France. The American Third Army 
under Lieutenant General (now General) George S. Patton, 
Jr., whose identity as commander of armored forces the Ger- 
mans had guessed, did not pause after Normandy was won. 
Columns of Third Army tanks, moving swiftly and secretly, 
debouched from Normandy and headed for three objectives. 
After capturing Rennes they overran Brittany to secure deep- 
water ports which the Allies needed, in addition to Cherbourg, 
for the supply of their immense forces of over a million men. 

309 



From Le Mans, east to Rennes, tank colunms circled north 
towards the Seine to catch the German Seventh Army with- 
drawing from Normandy, and still other colunms swept east 
on Paris to cut enemy communications. Spearhead of the 
Third Army's eastward drive was the XX Corps under Lieu- 
tenant General Walton H. Walker. 

Overrunning Brittany 

At Avranches, the exit from Normandy, the 6th Armored 
Division fought its way southeast through increasing German 
resistance to Pontorson [August 1, 1944]. The capture of 
this point gave the Americans a wide corridor into Brittany, 
where there was almost no resistance until they reached the 
fortified ports of St. Malo, Brest, Lorient, and St. Nazaire. 
The speed of the armored sweep west to the Brittany coast 
was slowed only by mines and occasional demolitions. From 
Pontorson, the tanks raced south forty miles in one day [Au- 
gust 2, 1944] down the road to Rennes, capital of Brittany, 
and moved in three colunms 125 miles west across the penin- 
sula to Brest in six days. All Brittany was then cut off from 
the rest of France by tanks which drove ninety miles south 
across the base of the peninsula to Nantes on the Loire River 
[August 10, 1944]. 

Large elements of four German divisions garrisoned the 
principal ports of Brittany, besieged by American infantry 
with the support of heavy artillery. St. Malo on the north 
coast was the first to surrender [August 17, 1944], but in 
Brest and Lorient, the enemy's strong fortifications made it 
difficult to dislodge his stubborn garrison. Coordinated as- 
saults by air, land, and naval forces [August 26-28, 1944], 
as at Brest, drove the enemy deeper into his forts. The be- 
leaguered Germans in Brittany were left far behind by the 
tide of battle rushing east from Normandy. 

The Falaise-Argentan Pocket 

The German Seventh Army, instead of withdrawing from 
Normandy when the Americans broke through their lines 
to Avranches, tried to cut the corridor [August 3, 1944] 
which Am.erican infantry had expanded over twenty miles 
from Avranches to Mortain and Domfront. Four panzer 

310 



divisions counterattacked [August 7, 1944] at the north end 
of the corridor and penetrated the American Hnes for three 
miles. Although they forced our advance units to evacuate 
Domfront and Mortain, they failed to break through to the 
sea. The American 3d Armored Division rushed to meet this 
counterattack and destroyed over one hundred German tanks 
with the support of dive bombers and antitank artillery. For 
four days [August 7-11, 1944] German armor wasted its 
strength vainly in furious jabs at the American lines, for 
even if it had reached the sea, it would have been enveloped 
by the American First Army pressing east. When the enemy 
counterattacks were spent, the Americans secured their cor- 
ridor by the recapture of Mortain and Domfront [August 
13-15, 1944]. 

Eastward between Falaise and Argentan the enemy now 
found himself caught in an exposed salient under pressure 
from elements of three Allied armies. The American First 
Army had continued to push east out of Normandy toward 
Vire, central bastion of the German line, and in cooperation 
with the Third Army it had swung south and east on a fifty- 
five-mile front deep into France as far as Alengon and Le 
Mans, enveloping the German left flank [August 9-11, 
1944]. On the right flank, the British Second Army con- 
tinued its offensive [August 8-14, 1944] southeast toward 
Falaise, which fell to Canadian units [August 16, 1944]. 
Polish and Canadian troops fanned out to Trun [August 18, 
1944] and met American tanks driving north from Argentan 
to seal the pocket. Six enemy divisions, besides elements of 
two more, were trapped. When the encircling Allied forces 
penetrated and sewed up the pocket during the next four 
days [August 19-23, 1944] they captured 25,000 prisoners, 
a considerable portion of what was left of the German 
Seventh Army. In the earlier stages of the offensive, the 
American First Army had captured 76,000 prisoners, the 
Third Army 31,500 and together they had buried 20,942 
enemy dead. The Battle of Normandy was over, and the 
Germans were in full retreat. 

Throughout the battle the American and British air forces 
had given Allied ground troops close tactical support. In 
addition, they had continued to wear down Nazi airpower 

311 



over both France and Germany. During the first seventy 
days of the invasion the Allied air forces destroyed 2,990 
enemy planes in aerial combat, 651 on the ground, and lost 
2,959 planes. 

III. ADVANCE TO THE GERMAN FRONTIER 

The Second Battle of France, like the First in 1940, was 
more a pursuit than a battle. In 1944, however, it was the 
Germans' turn to retreat before an overwhelming mass of 
troops armed with superior fire power and supported by 
planes and tanks in overwhelming strength. Even if the 
enemy had been able to stand his ground on any of the 
defense lines which he had held for four years in France 
during the last war, his forces would have been exposed to 
the flanking movement developed with the Allied invasion 
of the south of France. 

Allied Landings in Southern France: Operation Anvil 

Here on the coast between Toulon and Cannes the Amer- 
ican Seventh Army under Lieutenant General Alexander M. 
Patch, as well as French units, landed against light opposi- 
tion [August 15, 1944] and penetrated 140 miles inland in 
eight days. The amphibious expedition of more than 1,500 
ships, including two American and seven British aircraft 
carriers and a total of 641 American craft, was mounted in 
Corsica and Italy. From the Fifth Army in this theater were 
taken veterans of Sicily, Salerno, and Anzio, the U.S. 3d, 
36th, and 45th Divisions which made up the VI Corps under 
Lieutenant General Lucian K. Truscott, Jr., to spearhead 
the new invasion. Their objective, according to the order of 
General (now Field Marshal) Sir Henry Maitland Wilson, 
commanding the Allied forces in the Mediterranean, was "to 
drive out the Germans [from the south of France] and join 
up with the Allied armies advancing from Normandy." 

The landings were prepared by four days of heavy bom- 
bing. On D-day strong naval forces joined the tactical bomb- 
ers for two and a half hours in laying down a concentration 
of fire on the coast. The 1st Airborne Task Force, composed 
of British, French, and American units, was the vanguard of 
the invasion. British and American troops were dropped in- 

312 



land near Le Muy on the right flank of the projected beach- 
heads; on the left near Bormes, a French force came in with 
armor. They estabUshed roadblocks which were never 
needed, for the enemy did not send reinforcements. The 
German Nineteenth Army was holding the south of France 
with very weak forces; only two divisions defended one 
hundred miles of coast from Toulon to Nice. On the fifteen- 
mile beach front where the Seventh Army landed it en- 
countered two enemy regiments, half of whose personnel 
were Czech conscripts and Polish prisoners of war, who 
soon surrendered. Within three days after the landings 
[August 18, 1944], the Seventh Army, together with the 
French Forces of the Interior, which rose from the Under- 
ground, captured over ten thousand prisoners. 

Advance to the Bel fort Gap 

The main resistance met by the Seventh Army, as it 
fanned westward towards the Rhone valley, was at the naval 
base of Toulon and at the port of Marseille. The latter al- 
though farther west, was taken first [August 23, 1944], but 
not before the Germans had carried out their customary 
demolitions, wrecking the docks and warehouses and scut- 
tling ships in the entrance to the port. French infantry and 
tanks moved swiftly on Marseille and captured it after seal- 
ing off routes of escape. French forces also captured 
Toulon [August 26, 1944], enveloping it from the north and 
west, and penetrating to the southern forts after a week of 
bitter street fighting. With the end of organized resistance in 
these two cities [August 28, 1944] seven thousand more 
Germans were prisoners. 

Meanwhile the Americans drove rapidly north through the 
Durance Valley and reached the Rhone above Montelimar, 
one hundred miles from the sea. There they trapped one 
panzer division and elements of two other German divisions. 
This enemy force of some fifteen thousand men tried in vain 
to break through the American roadblocks [August 25 — 26, 
1944], but most of them were killed or captured. Farther 
east, the Americans advanced along the main railroad to 
Grenoble, whence they drove northwest to Lyon, the indus- 

313 



trial city which commands the railroads and communications 
of southern France. 

North from the Mediterranean coast, the Seventh Army 
pressed toward the Italian frontier. Here they were greatly 
aided by the Maquis, the French Forces of the Interior; for 
in these forested mountains bordering Italy and Switzerland, 
the Underground had trained its armies in the years of the 
Nazi captivity. Prisoners of war taken by the Allies in the 
first two weeks of the invasion were reported at fifty thou- 
sand. 

The Seventh Army swept north and east from Lyon, 
swinging around the Swiss border toward the Belfort Gap 
between the Vosges and the Jura Mountains. In September 
1944, it was pushing toward Alsace and the Rhine and had 
taken its place at the southern end of the Allied line, ready 
for the Battle of Germany. 

Liberation of Paris 

■ While the Seventh Army was overrunning the south of 
France, in the north the Third swept around Paris in a drive 
to turn the left flank of the German Fifteenth Army. From 
Le Mans, where American armor concentrated, columns of 
tanks raced north and east towards the Seine on an arc of 
seventy miles [August 14-20, 1944]. They reached the river 
on two sides of Paris, at Mantes thirty-five miles northwest 
of the city and at a point the same distance southeast, near 
Fontainebleau. 

Upon the approach of these armored spearheads, the peo- 
ple of Paris rose against their Nazi masters [August 19, 
1944]. Orders from Underground leaders brought fifty thou- 
sand armed members of the French Forces of the Interior, 
together with the unarmed populace, into the streets. They 
liberated large parts of Paris in four days of fighting. The 
French 2d Armored Division, veterans of Tunisa command- 
ed by General Jacques-Philippe Leclerc, came to the aid of 
the patriots, entering Paris from the south and west [August 
24, 1944] with American units following them. To these 
forces the German garrison of ten thousand surrendered 
[August 25, 1944] ; but sniping, particularly by Frenchmen 

314 



who had collaborated with the Nazis, continued for several 
days. 

After four years in captivity, Paris was free, the first 
capital of the United Nations to be reconquered from the 
Nazis. General Charles de Gaulle entered the city [August 
26, 1944], to become President four days later of the French 
Provisional Government which was established in coopera- 
tion with leaders of the Underground movement. General 
Eisenhower reviewed the Allied soldiers, French, American, 
and British who marched under the Arc de Triomphe. Then 
our troops moved out of the city toward the Marne in pursuit 
of the enemy. 

Allied Advance Toward Germany 

As armored columns of the American Third Army crossed 
the Seine River at Mantes and near Fontainebleau [August 
21, 1944] they enveloped Paris and turned the left flank of 
the German Fifteenth Army, now in full retreat from the 
Flanders coast. At the same time the British Second and 
American First Armies swung northeast toward the Seine 
and Belgium. On the left of this advance, Canadian units 
drove some elements of the enemy into a pocket below Le 
Havre and Rouen [August 22, 1944]. The British Second 
Army crossed the Seine between Rouen and Paris [August 
26, 1944], at Vernon and Louviers, and swept forward thirty- 
four miles towards the Somme River [August 29, 1944]. On 
the right, west of Paris, the American First Army cleaned up 
enemy rear guards on the south bank of the Seine and 
pushed beyond Laon to a point only thirty miles short of the 
Belgian border [August 26, 1944]. Still farther east, on the 
extreme right of an Allied front which now stretched nearly 
two hundred miles across northern France, the American 
Third Army continued to advance. From Paris, armored 
spearheads of the Third reached the Marne River [August 
27-28, 1944]. These units had been preceded by armored 
troops of the 4th Cavalry and a detachment of the 3d Ar- 
mored Division (First Army). The 3d Armored Division's 
drive went through Chateau-Thierry, took Soissons [August 
28-29, 1944], and closed in on Reims. Smashing through the 
Argonne Forest, the Third Army captured Verdun [August 

315 



3, 1944] and pressed on toward Metz and the German Saar. 
On the Channel coast, the Canadians took Dieppe [Septem- 
ber 1, 1944] and sealed off the Germans in the port of Le 
Havre, while the British Second Army, after an advance of 
sixty miles in two days, captured Amiens [August 31, 1944], 
crossed the Somme, took Arras, and pushed towards Lille. 
On their right, in what was now the center of the Allied line, 
the American First Army stormed Sedan and reached the 
Belgian frontier [August 31, 1944]. 

By the end of August the Allied offensive in France was 
five days ahead of schedule, General Eisenhower announced. 
The Germans had lost 400,000 men, of whom half were cap- 
tured. General Eisenhower reported that five panzer divi- 
sions had been destroyed, six more badly mauled; twenty 
infantry divisions had been eliminated, and twelve others 
disorganized. Total American casualties in France, killed, 
wounded and captured, were 112,673. This swift, overpow- 
ering offensive in France demonstrated the complete ma- 
turity of the American armies. 

Americans and Allies, united in command and in purpose 
to destroy Nazi power, were defeating the greatest military 
force that the world had ever known. In the east the massive 
strength of Russia was marshalled from the Baltic and East 
Prussia to the Balkans; on the west, Allied armies drove 
toward the Rhine and the Ruhr. As Allied troops crossed the 
western frontier of Germany, their Supreme Commander, 
General Dwight D. Eisenhower, issued a proclamation to the 
German people [September 28, 1944] : ''We come as con- 
querors, but not as oppressors . . . We shall overthrow the 
Nazi rule, dissolve the Nazi party and abolish the cruel, 
oppressive and discriminatory laws and institutions which 
the party has created. We shall eradicate that German mil- 
itarism which has so often disrupted the peace of the world." 

34. VICTORY IN THE WEST 

The Battle Over Ports 

The success of the Allied invasion of France and the de- 
struction of the greater part of the German Seventh Army 

316 



compelled a German retreat to the Siegfried Line. With the 
sweep across France Allied supply problems were multi- 
plied and ports became important objectives. Ports evac- 
uated by the Germans were blocked and harbor installa- 
tions thoroughly demolished. The stiffest delaying action 
was fought by the Germans in the north to deny the Allies 
use of the cross-Channel ports. Holland was stubbornly de- 
fended. A considerable number of German troops were left 
in French Atlantic ports with orders to fight to the last. 
They were supplied by plane or submarine, but in some 
cases possessed stores of food and munitions sufficient to 
last for many months. These units were doomed to ultimate 
death or capture, but as long as they held out, the Allies 
were unable to use these ports. According to German esti- 
mates, Allied supply and transport difficulties would be- 
come critical by the time the battle line reached the Ger- 
man frontier. 

German-held ports included Bordeaux, St. Nazaire, Lo- 
rient, and Dunkirk. The use of Marseille and Toulon was 
delayed after their capture by demolitions and by German 
garrisons on nearby islands. After the capture of Antwerp, 
its use was prevented by German garrisons holding out in 
the area surrounding the Scheldt River mouth. German 
garrisons on the Channel Islands were by-passed and re- 
mained there until the final surrender. About 130,000 Ger- 
man troops garrisoned these by-passed ports and areas. The 
Allies were forced to divert military personnel and supplies 
in order to contain them. 

Other ports came into Allied hands as a result of heavy 
fighting. The Canadian forces captured Dieppe [September 
1, 1944], scene of their heavy losses in 1942. Elements of 
the British Second Army entered Antwerp [September 4, 
1944] after a brilliant advance. The Canadian First Army 
cut off Calais and captured Ostend [September 6, 1944]. 
Two days later the same army carried the port of Le Havre 
by storm. After four days of bitter fighting the Canadian 
First Army captured Boulogne [September 18, 1944] to- 
gether with 10,000 German prisoners. Brest fell to the U.S. 
Ninth Army with 36,000 prisoners [September 19, 1944]. 
German resistance in the Cape Gris Nez sector ended [5^^- 

317 



tember 30, 1944] with the capture of Calais and 7,000 Ger- 
man prisoners by the Canadian First Army. 

I. BATTLES OF THE GERMAN FRONTIER 

While the Allied armies were making slow progress in 
driving the Germans out of Metz and other areas of Al- 
sace, plans were developed to outflank the Siegfried Line in 
the north. The Allied Supreme Command had a choice in 
September 1944. It could concentrate Allied military power 
on opening the port of Antwerp, or it could play for bigger 
stakes and attempt to outflank the Siegfried Line at Cleve, 
its northern hinge. If this operation were successful, it would 
prevent a German stand in the West and might conceiv- 
ably lead to a collapse of the Third Reich in the autumn. 
Allied Airborne Landings at Eindhoven and Arnhem 

Four days after the first units of the U.S. First Army 
crossed the Reich frontier some forty miles northwest of 
Trier, glider and paratroops of the First Allied Airborne 
Army, commanded by Lieutenant General Lewis H. Brere- 
ton, landed [September 17, 1944] at various pomis on a road 
stretching from Eindhoven to Arnhem, and at Nijmegen. 
Organized in Britain [August 18, 1944], the First Allied 
Airborne Army in this operation committed its British ist 
and U.S. 82d and 101st Airborne Divisions. 

The 82d Airborne Division was to capture the bridges over 
the Maas (Meuse) and Waal Rivers. The British 1st Divi- 
sion was landed farther north at Arnhem. It was to secure 
the crossing of the Neder Rijn (Rhine) at Arnhem. The 
British Second Army driving northward was to join up with 
the airborne units on the Zuyder Zee, at Nunspeet. It would 
take another offensive to turn the Siegfried Line. 

The landing of the Allied airborne troops took place al- 
most according to plan, but the German high command 
reacted violently to this threat against the northern flank. 
Progress of the British Second Army's armor moving up from 
Belgium was not up to schedule. Contact was made with the 
American forces at Eindhoven. The bridge over the Waal 
at Nijmegen was taken [September 20, 1944], and the Brit- 
ish reached the south bank of the Rhine [September 22, 

318 



2944]. German pressure on the Allied supply and reinforce- 
ment corridor to Nijmegen prevented further advances. After 
a week of heroic resistance in their isolated pocket at Arnhem, 
the remnants of the British 1st Airborne Division, about 2,400 
men, were evacuated to the British lines across the Rhine 
[September 25, 1944]. 

Capture of Aachen 

The first penetration of the German frontier in the West 
was made [September 11, 1944] by units of the U.S. First 
Army. When the Allied airborne thrust at Cleve failed, the 
U.S. First Army was fighting in the outskirts of the Sieg- 
fried Line approaching Aachen. Sustained fighting led to 
the penetration of the outer defenses of this city [October 
5,1944]. With the capture of Crucifix Hill [October 8, 
1944], the American encirclement of Aachen was almost 
complete. Demands for the unconditional surrender of the 
city were made [October 10, 1944] but refused by the Ger- 
mans. The American ring around Aachen was completed 
[October 16, 1944], and after heavy bombardment by ar- 
tillery and repeated air strikes, troops of the First Army cap- 
tured the city in bitter street fighting [October 21, 1944]. 

Aachen was the first large German city to fall into Al- 
lied hands. Its prewar population of 160,000 had been re- 
duced to about 8,000 through evacuation. Almost totally 
destroyed as a consequence of the futile German resistance, 
Aachen was a warning to the rest of the German nation. 
Later on many German cities decided to avoid similar de- 
struction by surrender. 

The Nazi government made an effort to popularize the 
tenacious defense of Aachen. It ordered German citizens 
not to leave their posts until ordered to do so by Wehr- 
macht officers. By decree of the Fiihrer [October 18, 
1944] , all German males between the ages of sixteen and 
sixty not already in the military service were to join a Ger- 
man Home Army, the Deutsche Wehrmacht Volkssturm, 
under direct command of SS Chief and Minister of the In- 
terior Heinrich Himmler. 

Clearing the Port of Antwerp 

It was accounted a prize of great value when the port of 

319 



Antwerp fell into Allied hands almost undamaged. If the 
Germans had simultaneously withdrawn from the territory 
surrounding the mouth of the Scheldt River, the magnifi- 
cent harbor installations and railroad connections of the 
port would have gone far toward solving Allied supply 
problems. However, a strong German garrison defended 
the islands of Walcheren and South Beveland. German bat- 
teries on both banks of the Scheldt denied Allied trans- 
ports entrance into the river mouth. The German 64th In- 
fantry Division held a line along the Leopold Canal on the 
south bank of the Scheldt. 

The task of opening the port of Antwerp fell to the Ca- 
nadian First Army, the British Second Army and Com- 
mando units. It proved to be a difficult and costly operation. 
Advances were made in this sector only after hard fighting 
and heavy losses. A crossing was made of the Leopold 
Canal by Canadian troops [October 6, 1944], but prompt 
German counterattacks limited their gains. Landings were 
made by British and Canadian forces on the south bank 
of the Scheldt estuary near Breskens [October 8-9, 1944], 
but German artillery fire prevented exploitation of the 
gains made. 

Operations by the British Second Army led to the cap- 
ture of Hertogenbosch [October 24, 1944], and Breda 
[October 29, 1944]. Attacks by RAF bombers carrying 
6-ton bombs cut the dikes around Walcheren Island and 
flooded a number of German battery positions, but some 
long-range German guns were still in operation on that is- 
land when the final attacks were driven home. Canadian 
troops cut the causeway from the mainland to South Beve- 
land [October 10, 1944], and German resistance on that 
island ended [October 30, 1944]. British Commando units 
landed on Walcheren Island at West Kapelle and Flushing 
[November 1, 1944], and after three days of fighting killed 
or captured the German garrison. The estuary of the 
Scheldt was finally free for the entrance of Allied trans- 
ports [November 3, 1944] . 

Hardly had the port of Antwerp been freed and put to 
use when the Germans began to attack it with V-1 bombs. 
Despite these attacks which caused heavy losses, hundreds 

320 



of thousands of tons of military goods flowed through this 
port to Allied armies on the German frontier. 

Rundstedt' s Ardennes Offensive 

While the Allied armies were preparing for their main 
attacks on the German frontier defenses and fighting their 
way forward in Alsace, the German high command de- 
cided to use their last strong reserve in a bold bid to break 
through the Ardennes, to isolate the British armies in the 
north, to take Liege and possibly Antwerp. Well equipped 
and trained V oiks grenadier divisions and panzer units were 
assembled under the cover of cloudy weather to augment 
German forces and to assault the thinly held Allied lines 
in the Ardennes area. An estimated force of 25 German di- 
visions was concentrated for the attack whose code name 
was ''Operation Greif." There had been no serious Ger- 
man counterattack since the ill-fated effort to block the 
Allied advance at Mortain in Normandy [August 3-7 , 
1944]. In preparation for their own coming offensive, Al- 
lied leaders accepted the "legitimate risk" involved in hold- 
ing the Ardennes area with limited forces. German prepara- 
tions for the attack were well concealed. A period of bad 
flying weather restricted Allied air reconnaissance, and the 
German assualt came as a surprise. 

The general area chosen for the German attack was that 
of the 12th Army Group (Bradley), consisting of the U.S. 
First, Third, and Ninth Armies. The point of the assault 
fell in the area of the VIII Corps (commanded by Major 
General Troy H. Middleton) of the U.S. First Army. 

The German drive was heralded by a sudden assault on 
Allied airfields by the carefully husbanded remnants of the 
Luftwaffe. After a short but heavy artillery preparation be- 
ginning at 0500 hours, an estimated force of 24 German di- 
visions comprising the Fifth and Sixth Panzer Armies sup- 
ported by the Seventh Army advanced through the heavily 
wooded but well roaded area of the Ardennes [December 16, 
1944]. For two days news about the German offensive was 
limited, but the announcement that the Germans had reached 
to within six miles of Stavelot [December 18, 1944] gave 

321 



some indication of the weight and speed of the German ad- 
vance. 

By the third day of the German offensive [December 19, 
1944], the situation in the Ardennes had taken so critical 
a turn that Allied command arrangements had to be altered. 
Because the rapid German advance threatened to cut Al- 
lied command communications, Field Marshal Montgomery 
commanding the 21st Army Group was placed in temporary 
command of the U. S. First and Ninth Armies. Allied 
reinforcements were hurriedly sent to the endangered area. 
Among these was the U. S. 101st Airborne Division, tem- 
porarily commanded by Brigadier General (now Major 
General) Anthony C. McAuliffe in the absence of the divi- 
sion commander. The 101st Airborne Division was ordered 
to the area around Bastogne and was destined to make an 
epic defense of that position. 

The 101st Airborne Division had barely taken up a posi- 
tion at Bastogne when the German advance cut the road 
to Neufchateau [December 20-21, 1944], isolating Bas- 
togne. As the German advance continued with paratroops 
dropping behind the American lines to disrupt our com- 
munications, SHAEF issued a General Order [December 22, 
1944] calling upon every man in the Allied armies to rise 
to new heights of courage and resolution and thus turn the 
Germans' greatest gamble into their greatest defeat. The 
counterattack of the U. S. Third Army made some progress 
but met heavy resistance between Arlon and Bastogne. The 
German advance westward reached its greatest penetration 
[December 24-25, 1944] when Celles was captured. At this 
stage the enemy was approaching the important communi- 
cations centers of Dinant and Namur. The Germans had 
driven forward more than fifty miles. If unchecked their 
advance threatened to cross the Meuse River. 

But the enemy never got beyond Celles. In fact they lost 
that position to an Allied counterattack [December 26, 
1944]. Repeated German attacks failed to widen the bulge 
either on the northern or southern shoulder. Meantime, in 
the south the advance of the U. S. Third Army continued, 
and the Germans were unable to reduce the tough pocket of 
the 101st Airborne Division at Bastogne. To a German re- 



quest for the surrender of the encircled garrison [December 
22, 1944], General McAuliffe replied: ''Aw, nuts"— which 
has gone down in history as "Nuts!" 

The first relief units of the U. S. Third Army to enter 
the lines of the 101st Airborne Division at Bastogne [De- 
cember 26, 1944] at 1650 hours were three tanks of Com- 
pany C, 37th Tank Battalion of the 4th Armored Division. 
These were followed by others and by infantry units. By the 
end of December Allied strength in the Bulge area was so 
great that all German hopes of continuing the offensive 
ended. Rundstedt's offensive was over and the Battle of the 
Bulge began. 

The Battle of the Bulge 

Rundstedt's surprise offensive in the Ardennes was a 
showy operation. It made the headlines and caused more 
concern in the British and American homelands than it did 
at SHAEF. The Allied high command, in possession of 
more information than it could release to the public, knew 
that the Germans were throwing in their last reserves. Gen- 
eral Eisenhower was reported to have said jokingly to 
General Bradley: "Brad, you've always wanted a German 
counterattack — now you've got it." 

Though certain American divisions were badly cut up in 
the first days of the offensive, the Allied armies in that area 
were competent and veteran fighters. They did not panic 
when the Germans unexpectedly rolled over their positions. 
The German advance and the time required to pinch out 
the Bulge probably set back the ultimate collapse of the 
Third Reich by thirty days. However, it made that collapse 
all the more inevitable by using up the last German reserves 
in the West. 

Allied efforts to reduce the Ardennes Bulge began before 
the German offensive had spent its force. The U. S. Third 
Army had been attacking from the south for many days. 
Apparently the Germans interpreted the check at Celles and 
the failure to take Bastogne as an indication that the salierit-^ 
could not be held. They defended their southern, and not th- 
ern flanks firmly but withdrew under heavy pressui>e from 
the tip of the salient, losing Rochefort [D^cefnber 30, 

323 



1944]. This stage of the fighting was accompanied by an- 
other outbreak of German air activity, and the Allied com- 
mand announced that 125 German planes were downed in 
air battles on January 1, 1945. 

The 21st Army Group launched a strong offensive on the 
northern flank of the Bulge [January 3, 1945]. Advances 
were made in heavy fighting along the line from Malmedy 
to Marche. Rain turning to snow, and ice hampered opera- 
tions. The temperature fell on this front to zero on Janu- 
ary 8. Fighting continued despite the weather and small 
Allied gains progressively reduced the German holdings in 
the salient. Laroche fell to units of the British 51st and 
U. S. 84th Divisions [January 10, 1945]. Houffalize was 
captured [January 16, 1945]. Further advances of the U. S. 
First Army led to the capture of the important road junction 
of St.Vith [January 23, 1945]. The Ardennes salient was 
practically reduced [January 28, 1945] when American 
troops crossed the Belgian-German frontier in this sector. 

As a measure to divert Allied strength elsewhere while the 
German withdrawal in the north was taking place, the Ger- 
man armies in northern Alsace launched a series of attacks 
against the U. S. Seventh Army near Reipertsweiler [Jan- 
uary 19-20, 1945]. A local American withdrawal to the 
Moder River was made during the following two days. A 
sector of northern Alsace remained in enemy hands until 
the Allied offensive to clear the Saar and the Palatinate 
began. 

An Allied offensive by the 6th Army Group, com- 
manded by Lieutenant General (now General) Jacob L. 
Devers, was launched on the line St. Amarin-Cernay-Mul- 
house in southern Alsace [January 20, 1945] aimed at re- 
ducing the last German foothold west of the Rhine. Colmar 
was entered by troops of the French First Army [February 
2, 1945]. A concentric advance on Rouffach [February 5, 
1945] cut off a considerable number of German troops. A 
general German withdrawal from southern Alsace to the 
east bank of the Rhine was completed [February 9, 1945]. 

The inability of the German armies to hold the Ardennes 
salient foreshadowed the Allied crossing of the Saar and the 
loss of the Palatinate. It showed that German reserves were 

324 



lacking to meet the two-front assault which came with the 
great Red Army offensive in January on the Eastern Front. 
The bitter fighting of the Battle of the Bulge had its effect 
on German morale. The Allied armies had demonstrated 
their moral and material superiority over the German troops. 
From this time on the German military situation in the West 
deteriorated rapidly. The Allied threat to the Cologne Plain, 
which probably was one of the German considerations in 
launching their offensive, could no longer be staved off. 

II. THE BATTLES OF GERMANY 

Order of Battle of the Allied Armies in Western Europe 

As the Allied armies in the West poised for the final battles 
of Germany, the Supreme Allied Commander was Army Gen- 
eral Dwight D. Eisenhower, USA. His deputy was Air Chief 
Marshal Sir Arthur Tedder, RAF, and his chief of staff was 
Lieutenant General Walter Bedell Smith, USA. Air Chief 
Marshal Sir Arthur Harris, RAF, was head of the Bomber 
Command of the RAF, and General Carl Spaatz was com- 
mander of the U. S. Strategic Air Forces in Europe. 

Allied armies were grouped from north to south as fol- 
lows: 
21st Army Group, Field Marshal Sir Bernard L. Montgomery 

Canadian First Army, Lieutenant General H. D. G. Crerar 

British Second Army, Lieutenant General Sir Miles C. 
Dempsey 
12th Army Group, General Omar N. Bradley 

U. S. Ninth Army, Lieutenant General William H. Simp- 
son 

U. S. First Army, Lieutenant General Courtney H. 
Hodges 

U. S. Third Army, Lieutenant General George S. Patton. 

U. S. Fifteenth Army, Lieutenant General L. T. Gerow 
6th Army Group, General Jacob L. Devers 

U. S. Seventh Army, Lieutenant General Alexander M. 
Patch 

French First Army, General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny 

The First Allied Airborne Army was commanded by Lieu- 
tenant General Lewis H. Brereton, the U. S. Eighth Air 

325 



Force by Lieutenant General James H. Doolittle, and the 
U. S. Ninth Air Force by Lieutenant General Hoyt S. 
Vandenberg. 

Breaking into the Cologne Plain 

With the defeat of their Ardennes offensive, the Germans 
were no longer able to forestall an Allied breakthrough into 
the Cologne Plain. Advances in the Roer sector were held up 
for some time by threat of flood waters controlled by the 
Roer dams, but this threat was removed when troops of the 
U. S. First Army captured the main Roer dam at Scham- 
menauel [February 10, 1945]. The 21st Army Group began 
an offensive in the north [February 9, 1945] which led to 
the capture of Cleve [February 12, 1945] and Goch [Feb- 
ruary 21, 1945]. Farther south, the U. S. Third Army 
crossed the Saar River near Saarburg [February 22, 1945], 
and the following day [February 23, 1945] the U. S. Ninth 
Army crossed the Roer River. Three days later [February 
26, 1945] troops of the U. S. First Army crossed the Roer 
River near Nideggen. Germany's river barriers were begin- 
ning to collapse. General Eisenhower announced [February 
24, 1945] that the mission of the new offensive was to 
destroy the German forces west of the Rhine. 

Under heavy pressure from three allied armies the Ger- 
mans withdrew from Miinchen-Gladbach, Venlo, and Roer- 
mond [March 1-2,. 1945]. Allied troops were now approach- 
ing the Rhine opposite Diisseldorf. Cologne, the first great 
German city to fall into Allied hands, was captured by troops 
of the U. S. First Army [March 5-6, 1945] . German troops 
withdrew across the Rhine destroying the Cologne bridges or 
retreated southward to Bonn. 

On the following day there occurred one of the great 
"breaks" of the war. Elements of the U. S. 9th Armored 
Division, after entering Rheinbach with little opposition, 
pushed forward its patrols to Remagen [March 7 , 1945] on 
the Rhine. Finding the Ludendorff Bridge intact but wired 
for demolition, an American patrol raced over the bridge ten 
minutes before the charges were set to explode. The capture 
of the Remagen bridge intact was an exploit of great daring 
and initiative. Tanks were poured across and infantry units 

326 



followed. In the words of Lieutenant General Walter Bedell 
Smith: "While the bridge lasted, it was worth its weight in 
gold." Several divisions were hastily sent across the Rhine 
and soon established a firm bridgehead. Repeated attacks 
by German aircraft and shelling by long range artillery 
weakened the bridge which had been damaged as it was cap- 
tured. It collapsed [March 17, 1945] after several days of 
use by our forces. 

Clearing the Saar and the Palatinate 

With the Remagen bridgehead established, the center of 
gravity of the Allied attack shifted to the Saar and the 
Palatinate. It was part of the overall Allied plan to clear 
this area before launching our armies across the Rhine for 
the final battles of Germany. 

The territory of the Saar and the Palatinate lying between 
the Moselle, the Saar, and the Rhine Rivers, was one of the 
richest German industrial districts. Its capture was en- 
trusted to the U. S. Third and Seventh Armies, and the 
French First Army. Operations began [February 19, 1945] 
in the Eifel area between Priim and the Moselle River. 
This area • had to be captured before the assault on the 
Moselle-Saar-Rhine triangle could begin. 

In steady fighting [February 19-March 11, 1945] enemy 
troops were cleared from most of the Eifel area, and a strong 
position established along the Rhine in the north. The north 
bank of the Moselle River was occupied from a point near 
Coblenz to Cochem. 

While these preliminary battles were being fought by the 
U. S. Third Army in the north, the U. S. Seventh Army was 
attacking from the south in the direction of Forbach, which 
was captured [March 5, 1945]. The Allied plan was to cut 
off the enemy's line of retreat across the Rhine by a concen- 
tric attack from north and south. The U. S. Third Army 
crossed the Moselle [March 15, 1945], while the Seventh 
Army was battling for possession of Hagenau and Saar- 
briicken. Rapid advances were made in the north as Co- 
blenz fell to the Third Army [March 16, 1945]. By-passing 
Mainz, the Third Army swept forward to Worms [March 20, 
1945] and Ludwigshafen [March 21, 1945]. The Seventh 

327 



Army captured Zweibriicken [March 20, 1945] and Pirma- 
sens [March 22, 1945]. From this time on, the reduction of 
the German pocket west of the Rhine was extremely rapid. 
The last German forces withdrew east of the Rhine [March 
25, 1945]. The Saar and the Palatinate together with many 
thousands of German prisoners were now in Allied hands. 
The stage was set for the crossing of the Rhine in force. 

Passage of the Rhine 

With the end of the campaign in the Saar and the Pala- 
tinate the German armies in the West were defending a line 
about 450 miles long running along the Rhine River from 
Switzerland to the North Sea. To man this line the Germans 
had an estimated force of 70 understrength divisions. By 
March 23, 1945, when the initial stages of the Rhine oper- 
ation began, the Remagen bridgehead had been extended to 
a depth of about 8 miles and a length of 25 miles. It con- 
stituted a strong sally port from which to exploit Allied 
crossings to the north or south. 

As the Allied armies lined up from north to south, the 21st 
Army Group held a front of about 95 miles from Holland to 
the neighborhood of Cologne. The 12th Army Group held 
a front of about 110 miles long from Cologne to the Neckar 
River. The 6th Army Group front extended southward from 
the Neckar. 

The Rhine crossing found the Allied armies in the West 
at the peak of their military strength. Their capacity to fight 
an "engineering war" was fully demonstrated during this 
gigantic operation. Allied air forces had driven the Luftwaffe 
to the ground. Strategic bombers had done their work so well 
that few remunerative targets remained in the Reich. With 
the preparations of the 21st Army Group in the north further 
developed than that of the American forces in the south, 
the Germans probably expected the major Allied crossings 
of the Rhine to take place in the north. But by March 23, 
1945, the Allied armies were, in fact, prepared to cross the 
Rhine all along the front. Allied air strikes and smoke 
screens covered the operation and seven armies almost si- 
multaneously crossed the Rhine. 

Immediately after the ground forces were committed, 

328 



troops of the First Allied Airborne Army were dropped be- 
hind the German lines and soon made contact with the 
troops which had crossed the Rhine. The operation was a 
spectacular success and one of the most highly coordinated 
large-scale movements of armies in history. 

The capacity of the American Army to overcome a great 
river barrier was demonstrated in bridging the Rhine. A 
total of 62 bridges were thrown across the Rhine by the 
American armies alone. Five of these were railway bridges 
(four of them over 2,200 feet long), built in an average 
construction time of nine days and one hour. Forty-six tac- 
tical (ponton) and 11 fixed highway bridges (average length 
1,256 feet) enabled us to throw our troops across the river 
in record time. In their construction we employed a total of 
4,600 boats, 6,000 ponton floats, 100,000 tons of bridging 
equipment, 2,500 outboard motors, 315,000 feet of wire rope, 
and 8,000 feet of chain. Seventy-five thousand engineers 
were engaged in the crossing operation, assisted by 124 naval 
landing craft, 72 Sea Mules, and 370 DUKWs, manned by 
893 naval ratings and 1,400 Army Transportation Corps 
troops. 

Springing the Ruhr Trap 

The 21st Army Group crossed the Rhine [March 23, 
1945] on a 15-mile front between Rees and Wesel. Airborne 
troops dropped in conjunction with the crossing captured 
several bridges over the Ijssel River intact. German strength 
was concentrated in the north and progress on the 21st Army 
Group front was necessarily less spectacular than on the 
12th Army Group front. At the end of the first day of oper- 
ations in the north a firm bridgehead five miles deep had 
been established. British units reached Miinster [March 31, 
1945] and captured it [April 3, 1945]. From this point on 
operations of the 21st Army Group aimed at the liberation of 
Holland and capture of the great German ports of Bremen 
and Hamburg, and pinning down German forces in the north. 

Operating on the flank of British units (as part of the 
21st Army Group until April 3) the U. S. Ninth Army ad- 
vanced to Lippstadt [April 1, 1945]. Here they made con- 
tact with elements of the U. S. First Army which had crossed 

329 



the Rhine south of Cologne and had swung westward and 
north to spring a trap around the Ruhr. 

Meanwhile the 12 th Army Group crossed the Rhine 
[March 22-23, 1945] on a front from Remagen to Oppen- 
heim. The U. S. First Army which fought its way from the 
Remagen bridgehead reached the Sieg River at Eidorf 
[March 26, 194S]. The U. S. Third Army which crossed the 
Rhine near Oppenheim reached Frankfurt-am-Main [March 
26, 1945] and began a house-to-house battle for its posses- 
sion. After hard fighting at Paderborn [March 30, 1945], 
elements of the U. S. First Army made contact with Ninth 
Army troops at Lippstadt [April 1, 1945]. This completed 
the encirclement of the Ruhr, and although considerable 
fighting followed before the last German resistance in the 
Ruhr ended [April 18, 1945], a bag of about 400,000 Ger- 
man troops fell into Allied hands. 

The Ruhr was the industrial heart of Germany and its 
capture ended Germany's ability to continue the war. Morale 
sagged in the German Army and many thousands of troops 
surrendered. Allied officers rightly described the encircle- 
ment and capture of the Ruhr as the greatest double- 
envelopment operation in history. 

Advance into Germany 

The 6th Army Group entered the campaign several days 
later than the Allied armies in the north. The U. S. Seventh 
Army captured Mannheim [March 29, 1945] and advanced 
toward Heidelberg. The French First Army crossed the 
Rhine [March 30, 1945] on a nine-mile front south of 
Speyer and reached the Neckar River south of Karlsruhe 
which was captured [April 4, 1945]. Fortified works of the 
Siegfried Line in this area made advances difficult and costly. 
Heilbronn was reached [April 6, 1945] but the Germans 
defended that town stubbornly for a week. A new crossing 
of the Rhine was made by units of the French First Army 
near Strasbourg [April 13, 1945] and led to the immediate 
capture of Kehl. Troops of the U. S. Seventh Army encircled 
Niirnberg [April 15-18, 1945], but resistance by German 
troops and civilians delayed the capture of the Nazi shrine 
city. It fell into our hands [April 21, 1945] almost com- 

330 



pletely destroyed. By this time German resistance in the 
south was crumbling. Stuttgart was occupied by the French 
First Army [April 22, 1945], and the general advance con- 
tinued. Crossing the Danube, French troops reached the 
Swiss border near Donaueschingen [April 22, 1945], cutting 
off German garrisons in the Siegfried Line south of Breisach. 
Friedrichshafen was occupied by troops of the French First 
Army [April 30, 1945]. A crossing of the Austrian frontier 
was made [April 30, 1945] at the eastern end of Lake Con- 
stance. 

After the Ruhr trap had been closed, its reduction was left 
to elements of the U. S. Ninth and First Armies. The rest 
of the Allied armies pushed on into Germany. The 21st 
Army Group advanced northward against strong opposition 
into Holland and the German coastal area. Its objective was 
to isolate the German forces in the Netherlands and take 
the great German ports of Bremen and Hamburg. The Ca- 
nadian First Army captured Arnhem after heavy fighting 
[April 13, 1945] and reached the Ijsselmeer east of Amster- 
dam [April 18, 1945]. The British Second Army reached the 
vicinity of Bremen [April 8-9, 1945] but was held up by 
strong German resistance. On May 2, 1945, the British Sec- 
ond Army reached the Baltic. By this time the German Army 
in the West had reached the end of the road. Surrenders were 
taking place all along the front on a tremendous scale. 

Kiel and Flensburg were declared to be "open cities" by 
the government of Admiral Doenitz [May 2, 1945], the 
same day that the British Second Army occupied Liibeck. 
Surrender negotiations were initiated by Admiral Von Frie- 
deburg [May 3, 1945], who approached Field Marshal 
Montgomery with a request for terms. Oldenburg arid Ham- 
burg were surrendered to the British Second Army [May 3, 
1945], and with Liibeck in British hands, the 21st Army 
Group was at the approximate line agreed upon with the 
Russians at Yalta. 

Admiral Von Friedeburg surrendered all German naval 
and land forces in Holland, Northwest Germany, and Den- 
mark to Field Marshal Montgomery [May 5, 1945] at 0800 
hours. 

It was on the 12 th Army Group front that the most spec- 

331 



tacular advances were made after closing the Ruhr trap. 
Kassel was captured [April 4, 1945]. Hanover fell to troops 
of the U. S. Ninth Army [April 10, 1945], the same day that 
the U. S. First Army reached Nordhausen and the Third 
Army attacked Erfurt. Great advances were made [April 
11, 1945] when the U. S. Ninth Army reached the Elbe 
River near Madeburg after a 50-mile drive. Not to be out- 
done, the U. S. Third Army almost equalled this with a 46- 
mile advance to cross the Saale River near Jena. By April 15, 
the Ninth Army had two bridgeheads over the Elbe near 
Madeburg and had reached the Mulde River southeast of 
Leipzig, the First Army had reached the Mulde River south 
of Dessau, and the Third Army had captured Bayreuth and 
was closing in on Chemnitz. 

The pace of operations slowed somewhat after April 15 
because the U. S. armies had reached the approximate line 
agreed upon at Yalta. Halle was captured by troops of the 
U. S. First Army [April 19, 1945], and Leipzig was com- 
pletely in American hands the following day [April 20, 
1945]. The U. S. Third Army continued its advance through 
the Harz Mountains and reached the Czechoslovakian fron- 
tier near Tirschenreuth [April 23, 1945]. Munich was occu- 
pied by troops of the \J. S. Seventh Army [April 29-30, 
1945]. 

Junction of the Allied Armies 

A junction of the Allied and Russian armies in the heart 
of Germany was one of the long-sought objectives of United 
Nations' strategy. It would symbolize the dismemberment of 
the Third Reich and set the seal on" United Nations soli- 
darity. In the last months of the struggle the only hope 
remaining to the Nazi leaders was that the Allies would fall 
to quarreling among themselves. At Yalta the Allies had 
set the future junction point on the Elbe River. 

Foreseeing a possible junction of the Allied and Russian 
armies. Hitler issued a General Order [April 16, 1945] di- 
viding the Reich into two defense areas. Hitler remained in 
command of the North Defense Area and apparently main- 
tained his headquarters in Berlin until the last. The South 
Defense Area was entrusted to SS Chief and Minister of the 



Interioi Heinrich Himmler. This area included the moun- 
tainous district in southern Germany where the fanatical 
Nazis were expected to put up a last-ditch defense of the 
so-called "National Redoubt." 

The "National Redoubt," like so many Nazi propaganda 
inventions, turned out to be a gigantic hoax. Himmler did 
not even stay in the South Defense Area but attempted sep- 
arate peace negotiations with the Allies after Hitler's alleged 
death. He was finally arrested in civilian clothes with forged 
papers trying to escape the Allied dragnet after the sur- 
render. Choosing suicide rather than face trial as a war 
criminal, Himmler took poison and died [May 23, 1945]. 

The actual meeting of the Allied and Russian armies took 
place on the banks of the Elbe River near Torgau [April 27, 
1945] when a patrol of the 69th Infantry Division made 
contact with a patrol of the First Ukrainian Army. Germany 
was cut in two parts, and the end was near. 

Disintegration and Surrender of the German Armies in the 
West 

The Germans acknowledged that the end was near when 
Hitler divided the Reich into two defense areas. He made it 
even clearer in another General Order [April 19, 1945] call- 
ing upon Wehrmacht leaders to cease attacks on Allied 
strong points and concentrate on weak points. He stressed 
the desirability of waging small war on Allied communica- 
tions and supply centers. Using the illustration of the success 
of the Russian partisans in 1942-44, he called upon German 
troops everywhere to wage guerrilla warfare. Dr. Goebbels' 
propaganda ministry created one last bogey-man. He now 
called upon all Germans behind the Allied lines to become 
"Werewolves" and kill Allied troops. 

Since the 21st Army Group had reached its objectives 
[May 1, 1945], advances were thereafter confined to the 6th 
Army Group front. Passau was captured [May 2, 1945]. 
On the following day [May 3, 1945] Seventh Army troops 
crossed the Inn River and reached Innsbruck. Combat pa- 
trols of the U. S. 103rd Division made contact with the Fifth 
Army advancing from Italy toward the Brenner Pass. Junc- 
tion was made at Vitipeno [May 4, 1945]. Fighting ended 

333 



on this front [May 5, 1945] with the surrender of German 
Army Group G. 

The disintegration of the German armies in the West is 
illustrated by the rapidly increasing rate of prisoners taken 
from March onward. During the month of March the aver- 
age daily bag of prisoners was 18,000. In the first two weeks 
of April the daily average of German prisoners taken rose to 
42,500. These men did not surrender because they lacked 
weapons, ammunition, or food. They were short of gasoline 
for their armored units and planes, but they still were able 
to fight a delaying action. They surrendered because they 
knew the war was lost. The frantic Nazi propaganda cam- 
paign to keep the people and the army fighting had no effect 
upon them. They came in individually and in droves. By 
the end of April prisoners were coming into Allied cages in 
uncounted numbers. The grand total of military prisoners 
taken in the West [March 1-May 5, 1945] was 2,835,000. 

With the Russian armies assaulting Berlin, Heinrich 
Himmler appealed [April 23-24] through Count Folke Ber- 
nadotte of Sweden to the governments of Britain and the 
U. S. asking for a separate peace. This was refused. On May 
1, 1945, Grand Admiral Karl Doenitz announced to the Ger- 
man people that Adolf Hitler had died and that he had been 
designated as Fiihrer. Surrender negotiations were again 
opened by Admiral Doenitz [May 3, 1945] who sent Ad- 
miral Von Friedeburg on a mission to see Field Marshal 
Montgomery. Admiral Von Friedeburg signed the surrender 
of the German forces confronting the 21st Army Group ef- 
fective May 5, 1945. He then proceeded to Reims where he 
was joined [May 6, 1945] by Colonel General Alfred Jodl, 
Chief of Staff of the Wehrmacht. There [May 7, 1945] at 
0230 hours, Jodl signed the act of surrender for the German 
high command. Lieutenant General Walter Bedell Smith 
signed for General Eisenhower, General Ivan Susloparoff 
for the Soviet high command, and General F. Sevez for the 
French. The text of the Reims surrender is given in Ap- 
pendix IX. 

On the following day [May 8, 1945] a second act of sur- 
render was signed at Berlin by Field Marshal Wilhelm 
Keitel as Chief of the German high command in the presence 

334 



of Marshal Gregory Zhukov of the Soviet Union, Air Chief 
Marshal Sir Arthur Tedder, and General Carl Spaatz. 

III. THE FINAL OFFENSIVES IN ITALY 

Order of Battle of the Allied Armies in Italy 

After the Allied offensives in Italy during the autumn of 
1944 which saw the U. S. Fifth and the British Eighth 
Armies advance from the Gothic Line \ September 1, 1944] 
to a line running from Viareggio-Barga-Vergato-Faenza- 
Ravenna [December 26, 1944], the Allied command was 
reorganized. Field Marshal Sir Harold Alexander replaced 
Field Marshal Sir Henry Maitland Wilson as Supreme Al- 
lied Commander in the Mediterranean. Lieutenant General 
(now General) Joseph T. McNarney (appointed November 
1, 1944) remained as Deputy Commander and as Com- 
mander of all American forces in the Mediterranean. Lieu- 
tenant General (now General) Mark W. Clark, formerly 
commander of the U. S. Fifth Army, became commander of 
the 15th Army Group.

Italy was long regarded by the Allied troops who fought 
and worked there as the "forgotten front." From the land- 
ings at Reggio di Calabria [September 3, 1943] and Salerno 
[September 8, 1943], through the bloody battles of the 
Gustav Line, Cassino, Anzio. Rome, and northward, the 
Allied forces had engaged a numerous, well equipped and 
well led enemy. Some of the bitterest fighting and severest 
hardships of the European war were the lot of the troops in 
Italy. If the gains measured in terms of miles did not seem 

335 



great, the troops of the U. S. Fifth and British Eighth 
Armies had the satisfaction of knowing that their fighting 
kept an estimated 25 German divisions tied down. in Italy 
while the decisive campaigns of the war were being carried 
out by Allied and Russian armies against the Reich itself. 
In the end they shattered the German forces in Italy. 

The German Collapse in Italy 

The German forces in Italy held the rich Po Valley with 
the populous industrial centers of Turin and Genoa. Under 
protection of German bayonets, Mussolini re-created the 
fiction of power by establishing a so-called Italian Socialist 
Republic. Marshal Rodolfo Graziani, defeated by Wavell in 
Libya, headed a handful of Italian Fascist divisions under 
the Germans. Until the spring of 1945, the German com- 
mander in Italy was Field Marshal Albert Kesselring. He 
was recalled to take command of the failing German de- 
fenses in the homeland and his place was taken by General 
Heinrich von Vietinhoff-Scheel. 

The final Allied offensive began on the Italian front [April 
9, 1945] . It coincided in point of time with a drive launched 
by French forces on the French-Italian frontier. The British 
Eighth Army drove forward toward Argenta [April 19, 
1945] while the U. S. Fifth Army advanced toward Bologna 
which fell [April 21, 1945]. Porto Maggiore was captured 
by the Eighth Army [April 21, 1945], but repeated attacks 
on Ferrara failed to shake the German garrison. 

Perhaps because they realized that the fate of the Reich 
had already been decided on the battlefields of Germany, the 
German troops in Italy then quit fighting in large numbers. 
They surrendered Ferrara, La Spezia, and Modena together 
with 40,000 prisoners [April 23, 1945]. The Allied armies 
thereupon advanced rapidly; both armies reached the Po 
River [April 23, 1945] and crossed it [April 25, 1945]. 
Troops of the U. S. Fifth Army entered Genoa [April 25, 
1945]. Brescia, Vicenza, Padua, and Milan were entered by 
Allied troops [April 28-29, 1945]. 

Partisan troops arrested Mussolini in Como [April 28, 
1945] and shot him. Other former Fascist leaders were 
rounded up and executed. April 30 was a great day of liber- 

336 



ation in northern Italy: Venice was freed by partisan troops 
and American forces entered Turin. British troops of the 
Eighth Army crossed the Piave River and the total bag of 
German prisoners captured in northern Italy rose to 100,000. 
General Mark W. Clark declared [April 30, 1945] that 25 
German divisions in northern Italy had been destroyed and 
that German military power had practically ceased to exist 
on that front. 

Contact was made [May 1, 1945] between patrols of the 
British Eighth Army and forces of Marshal Tito advancing 
westward from Trieste. The northward sweep of the U. S. 
Fifth Army reached to within two miles of the Swiss frontier 
[April 29, 1945]. At Vitipeno [May 4, 1945] contact was 
made between patrols of the U. S. Fifth Army and those of 
the U. S. Seventh Army. The campaign in northern Italy 
was now over. 

Surrender negotiations covering the German forces in 
Italy were instituted by General Von Vietinhoff-Scheel 
[April 26, 1945]. Emissaries representing him and Ober- 
gruppenfiihrer Karl Wolff, Chief of the SS and German 
General Plenipotentiary of the Wehrmacht in Italy, arrived 
by plane at Casserta [April 28, 1945], They signed an act of 
surrender covering all the German and Italian military forces 
in Italy and southern Austria. Hostilities ceased on this front 
[May' 2, 1945] at 1200 hours. 

IV. THE END OF THE LUFTWAFFE AND THE GERMAN NAVY 

Order of Battle of the Allied Air Forces in Western Europe 

From September 1, 1944, to May 8, 1945, the order of 
battle of the Allied Air Forces in Western Europe was as 
follows : 

Great Britain ' • 

Marshal of the Royal Air Force: Sir Charles Portal 

Commander in Chief of the Bomber Command: Air Chief 
Marshal Sir Arthur Harris 

Commander in Chief of the Fighter Command: Air Mar- 
shal Sir R. Hill 

337 



Commander in Chief of the Second Tactical Air Force: 

Air Marshal Sir Arthur Coningham 
Commander in Chief of the Coastal Command: Air Chief 

Marshal Sir William Sholto Douglas 

United States 

Commander of U. S. Strategic Air Forces in Europe: 
General Carl Spaatz 

Commander, U. S. Eighth Air Force: Lieutenant General 
James Doolittle 

Commander, U. S. Ninth Air Force: Lieutenant General 
Hoyt S. Vandenberg 

The prelude to the defeat of the Luftwaffe may be said to 
have taken place [February 20-26, 1944] when the U. S. 
Eighth Air Force carried out a series of heavy raids on Ger- 
man aircraft plants at Regensburg, Augsburg, Fiirth, and 
Stuttgart. These raids were aimed at two objectives: to 
force German fighter planes to give battle; second, to strike 
at German plane replacements in the manufacturing phase. 
The February raids cut fighter strength considerably and 
helped the Allied invasion. The contribution of Allied tac- 
tical air forces to the successful outcome of the battles of 
France and Germany was very great. German generals have 
testified to the effectiveness of Allied fighter bombers in dis- 
rupting communications and tactical organizations. 

Repeated raids by Allied heavy bombers had cut down the 
manufacture of German planes, ball bearings, and aviation 
fuel. By the autumn of 1944 Germany could still produce 
planes, but she could no longer provide pilots, replacement 
crews, ground crews, spare parts, fuel, and safe bases for the 
continuous operation of all these planes. A considerable part 
of Germany's air reserve was exoended in the Rundstedt 
offensive and the Battle of the Bulge. Speedy jet-propelled 
fighters and fighter bombers, notably the Messerschmitt 262 
and the Arado 234, were introduced but could not cope with 
the overwhelming power of the Allied air forces because of 
shortages of fuel and the breakdown of organization in the 
Luftwaffe. Air Chief Marshal Douglas revealed that nearly 
2000 serviceable German aircraft were found in the British 
zone of occupation after the surrender. 

338 



Destruction of the Luftwaffe 

As the battle line reached the German frontiers, the Luft- 
waffe was restricted to the use of airfields in Germany. It 
made a concentrated target. Unable to stave off the constant 
Allied attacks on its flying fields, the Luftwaffe's plane losses 
on the ground rapidly mounted. As the Allied strategic 
bombing program reached its final stages, the fighter planes, 
which hitherto escorted bombers, were now able to attack 
German flying fields. General Carl Spaatz announced [April 
15, 1945] that the strategic air war against Germany had 
been successfully terminated. Henceforth U. S. heavy bomb- 
ers were to be used for tactical purposes. 

In eight days of relentless bombing and strafing [April 
10-18, 1945] fighter bombers of the U. S. Eighth Air Force 
destroyed some 2,000 German planes on the ground. It was 
the greatest destruction of enemy air power achieved during 
the war. German plane losses in April were estimated at 
about 5,000 planes and most of them were destroyed on the 
ground. No air force in the world could stand such losses. 
Foreseeing the end, Reichsmarschal Hermann Goering re- 
signed [April 26, 1945] as head of the Luftwaffe. He was 
replaced by Colonel General Robert Ritter von Greim, who 
committed suicide at Salzburg [May 24, 1945]. In the last 
days of the war the Luftwaffe ceased to be a factor of mili- 
tary importance. It simply dissolved in chaos. The largest 
organized unit, some 48,000 men, was captured in the Amer- 
ican zone. Most of the Luftwaffe personnel were given rifles 
and hastily converted into infantry. 

Allied Air Attacks on the Reich 

It will be some time before the full extent of damage in- 
flicted upon the Reich and its capacity to wage war by the 
Allied air forces can be accurately determined. All the lead- 
ing German military and industrial prisoners taken in the 
last days of the war agree that strategic bombing contributed 
greatly to the final defeat of the Reich. Field Marshal Von 
Rundstedt, captured south of Munich [May 1, 1945] listed 
four main reasons for the military collapse of Germany: 

(1) The Allies' tremendous air superiority, which ham- 
pered Gierman troop movements. 

339 



(2) Lack of fuel for tanks and "the few planes we still 
had," resulting from the Allied air offensive against syn- 
thetic oil plants, and the loss of the Rumanian oil fields. 

(3) The systematic destruction by the Allied air forces 
of the Reich's railway communications. 

(4) The destruction by air of Germany's industrial cen- 
ters, and the loss of Silesia, which prevented production of 
arms and ammunition. 

Strategic bombing did not destroy all German industry; it 
knocked out key plants. Gasoline and oil were so scarce in 
Germany during the last weeks of the war that panzer units 
and planes were immobilized, A considerable amount of 
manufacturing was done in underground plants in Germany, 
but it was not enough to stave off defeat. 

The main failure of the Luftwaffe was in not being able 
to fight off the strategic bombers of the Allied air forces. 
From the beginning of the war to May 8, 1945, British and 
American planes dropped a total of 2,453,595 tons of bombs 
on Germany and on German occupied targets in Europe. 
This was 315 times as great a tonnage of bombs as the Luft- 
waffe dropped on Britain during the same period. The RAF 
flew a total of 2,314,651 sorties in the war against the Axis 
in Europe. British and American bomber losses for the war 
in Europe amounted to 8,001. The U. S. Army Air Forces 
lost 7,165 fighter planes in Europe. RAF losses to V-E day 
in the European and Mediterranean theaters were 16,385 
planes and 104,514 officers and men. Against these losses the 
Germans lost to the U. S. Army Air Forces alone an esti- 
mated 20,574 planes in the air and 12,337 on the ground. 
The table of Axis plane losses in Europe up to May 5, 1945 
(excluding planes lost on the ground) kept by the British 
magazine The Aeroplane, lists a total of 31,298 planes de- 
stroyed. 

In its operations up to May 8, 1945, the U. S. Eighth 
Air Force flew a total of 616,000 bomber and 260,574 fighter 
plane sorties. It destroyed a total of 11,439 enemy aircraft 
in the air and 4,207 on the ground. It dropped 701,300 tons 
of bombs on enemy targets, destroyed 4,660 locomotives, 
6,038 freight cars, 1,449 tank cars, and 4,882 trucks. It 
damaged many more. The U. S. Ninth Air Force flew a total 

340 



of 400,000 sorties and destroyed 4,228 enemy planes. Its 
losses were 2,944 planes. The U. S. Twelfth Air Force flew 
a total of 377,069 sorties and dropped 198.042 tons of bombs 
on enemy targets. The U. S. Fifteenth Air Force flew a total 
of 280,987 sorties and dropped 380,047 tons of bombs. 
Further statistics on the operations of Allied Air Forces in 
Europe are given in Appendices VI, VII and VIII. 

The contribution of Allied air forces to the victory in 
Europe did not end with the destruction of the German air 
force and with strategic bombing. Tactical aviation played 
a very great part in the destruction of the German Army. 
Transport planes aided enormously in the Rhine crossing 
aod in supplying the fast-moving Allied armored forces in 
the drive into central Germany. 

Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery summed up the 
gratitude of Allied ground forces for the contribution of the 
air forces to the final victory by writing to Marshal of the 
Royal Air Force, Sir Charles Portal, as follows: 

''At this historic moment I would like to express to you 
the deep sense of gratitude that we soldiers owe to you and 
your splendid force. The mighty weapon of air power has 
enabled us, first to win a great victory quickly, and secondly, 
to win that victory with fewer casualties than would other- 
wise have been the case. We are all deeply conscious of 
these facts." 

The End of the German Navy 

The German fleet had never possessed enough strength in 
surface vessels to challenge the Royal Navy. After losing 
several valuable ships in attacks on Allied convoys, the Ger- 
man fleet restricted its operations on the high seas. With the 
replacement of Grand Admiral Erich Rader [January 30, 
1943] as head of the Navy by Admiral (later Grand Ad- 
miral) Karl Doenitz, the chief occupation of the German 
fleet was to support the U-boat war. After the destruction of 
the 26,000-ton Nazi battleship Scharnhorst [December 26, 
1943] by ships of the Home Fleet under Admiral Sir Bruce 
Eraser, the German fleet undertook few sorties from German 
harbors. Individual German ships operated in the Baltic, the 
Channel, and in Norwegian waters, but they lived a danger- 

341 



ous existence and were constantly harassed by Allied air 
power. 

In 1944 the most powerful German warship in commission 
was the 4 5, 000- ton battleship Tirpitz. This vessel went into 
hiding in Tromso Fjord, Norway, behind torpedo nets and 
antiaircraft screens. Damaged by repeated RAF attacks, the 
Tirpitz was sunk [November 12, 1944] by RAF Lancasters 
carrying six-ton ''earthquake" bombs. 

During the Russian advance along the Baltic, German 
surface ships occasionally operated against enemy ground 
forces, but as the amount of German-controlled territory 
dwindled, the ships of the German Navy were driven into 
their own or Danish harbors. Here they came under repeated 
heavy air attacks in the last days of the war. In April and 
early May all the German ships were scuttled, sunk by 
Allied action, or surrendered. 

The 10,000- ton pocket battleship Admiral Scheer was 
sunk by planes of the RAF while at its dock in Kiel [April 
9, 1945] . The 6,000-ton cruiser Koln was found sunk in dock 
at Wilhelmshaven. The cruisers Admiral Hipper and Emden 
were found damaged at Kiel along with 11 destroyers. The 
10,000-ton pocket battleship Liitzow was scuttled or sunk in 
Swinemiinde harbor. The 26,000-ton battleship Gneisenau 
(sister ship to the Scharnhorst) was found sunk as a block 
ship in Gdynia harbor along with the old battleship Sckles- 
wig-Holstein. The incomplete 25,000-ton carrier Graj Zep- 
pelin was damaged at Stettin. The 6, 000- ton cruiser Leipzig 
was surrendered in a damaged condition at the Danish port 
of Aabenraa. The heavy cruiser Seydlitz was blown up in 
Konigsberg. The only German surface vessels found in a 
condition to take the sea were the 10,000-ton cruiser Prinz 
Eugen, the 6, 000- ton cruiser Niirnberg, and some 24 de- 
stroyers which surrendered to the Allies at Copenhagen, 

German U-boats in harbor or at sea were included in the 
act of surrender signed at Reims. Up to the end of 1942, 
German U-boats took a heavy toll of Allied shipping, but 
they did not prevent the transfer of American military 
power to Europe. A total of 4,453,061 American troops were 
embarked from the United States to participate in the war 
against the European Axis. Of this total only 3,604 men were 

342 



lost at sea from all causes including German U-boats. This 
amounted to .04 per cent of the troops shipped, as compared 
to .072 per cent lost at sea in the First World War. A grand 
total of 4,770 Allied and neutral ships aggregating 21,- 
140,000 gross tons was lost during the period of the Euro- 
pean war. U-boats accounted for 2,770 of these vessels, ag- 
gregating 14,500,00 gross tons. The remainder were lost to 
mines, aircraft, surface vessels, accidents, and other causes. 
Details of Allied shipping losses are given in an appendix to 
this volume. 

The final surrenders of German naval and military per- 
sonnel in the Channel Islands and isolated French ports oc- 
curred [May 9, 1945] when Rear Admiral Frisius of the 
Dunkirk garrison signed an act of surrender covering a 
total of about 130,000 men in the French ports and Channel 
Islands. 

35. VICTORY IN THE EAST 

I. RED ARMY AUTUMN OFFENSIVES, 1944 

The German Military Situation 

In the autumn of 1944 Germany's military situation was 
hopeless. Her armies in the West were retreating to the 
Siegfried Line. Finland, Rumania, and Bulgaria had been 
knocked out of the war as a result of Russian victories. The 
Red Army had driven the Wehrmacht to the frontiers of 
East Prussia and the gates of Warsaw. Nazi leaders were 
feverishly preparing to defend Hungary and Austria. Ger- 
man hopes of European domination were shattered. Ger- 
many was isolated and her armies were stretched out from 
Norway to Crete, from Holland to Switzerland, and from 
the Baltic Sea to Belgrade. Her air force had been reduced 
to a remnant and her war industries and communications 
system were being reduced to rubble by Allied bombers. It 
was beyond Germany's power to defeat the armies of the 
United Nations or seriously damage their war industrial cen- 
ters. Germany was defeated, but she could not make peace. 
Her leaders, facing death sentences as war criminals, could 

343 



not surrender. Their only recourse was to continue tiie war 
in the hope that the United Nations might split. 

On the pretext of "saving Europe from Bolshevism," Ger- 
man propagandists tried to sow discord among the United 
Nations. Fearing Russia because of their own barbarous 
conduct in Russian territory, the Germans concentrated their 
main ground forces on the Eastern Front. The German strat- 
egy of holding on to every inch of territory for political and 
ideological reasons produced the conditions of final defeat in 
the winter and spring of 1945. A greatly superior Red Army, 
striking first at one point and then at another along the im- 
mense Eastern Front, kept the German armies off balance 
and steadily drove them back to the heart of Germany. Only 
at certain points where prestige values were at stake were 
the Germans able to put up a prolonged defense of any area 
the Russians chose to attack. But Russian power over- 
whelmed the fanatical defenders of these hold-out points. 

Order of Battle of the Soviet Armies 

At the beginning of September 1944, the order of battle of 
the Red Army was as follows: Marshal of the Soviet Union, 
Joseph Stalin; Chief of Staff of the Red Army, Marshal A. 
M. Vassilievsky ; Chief of the Red Army Artillery, Marshal 
N. Voronov; Chief of the Red Army Aviation, Marshal A. 
Novikov. 

From north to south Soviet Armies or Army Groups were 
deployed as follows: 

Leningrad Army, Marshal L. Govorov 

Third Baltic Army, Colonel General I. S. Maslenikov 

Second Baltic Army, General A. Yeremenko 

First Baltic Army, Colonel General I. C. Bagramian 

Third White Russian Army, Colonel General I. D. Cher- 

nyakovsky 
Second White Russian Army, Colonel General M. Za- 

kharov 
First White Russian Army, General K. Rokossovsky 
First Ukrainian Army, Marshal G. K. Zhukov 
Fourth Ukrainian Army, Colonel General I. Y. Petrov 
Second Ukrainian Army, Marshal R. Y. Malinovsky 
Third Ukrainian Army, General F. Tolbukhin 
344 



The composition of these armies is unknown and their 
alignment changed during the ensuing campaigns. In some 
instances these units were in reality army groups. The Rus- 
sian communiques commonly referred to army fronts rather 
than armies or army groups as in the Western tradition. 
Thus Marshal G. K. Zhukov was in all probability com- 
manding the 1st Ukrainian Army Group for we hear of 
Marshal I. S. Konev commanding the First Ukrainian Army 
under him. 

The strength and composition of the German forces on the 
Eastern front are unknown but it has been estimated that 
over 2,000,000 men were detailed to defend the German 
front in the East. In the final stages of the war the Germans 
switched the numbers and names of divisions and battle 
groups so frequently that the preparation of a battle order of 
German units is impossible. Because of the lack of detailed 
information on operations of both the German and Russian 
armies, the account of the iinal campaigns on the Eastern 
front as given in this volume is necessarily brief and inade- 
quate. 

The Campaign in the Baltic and Poland 

Advances of the Red Army on the northern front reached 
the Narev River [September 5, 1944] and cleared the east- 
ern bank of the Bug River [September 6, 1944]. Operations 
of the Leningrad Arm.y led to the capture of Tallinn [Sep- 
tember 22, 1944], capital of Estonia, and freed the Gulf of 
Finland. A large-scale offensive mounted by the Third and 
Second Baltic Armies on a 160-mile front between Lake 
Peipus and the Dvina River [September 16, 1944] led to the 
investment [September 26, 1944] and the fall of Riga 
[October 13, 1944]. 

Immediate use of the port of Riga was denied the Rus- 
sians by Germans garrisoning Oesel Island and by a large 
force left to hold a beachhead on Riga Gulf between Ventspils 
and Liepaja. Troops of the First Baltic Army attacked the 
Sworbe Peninsula on the southern end of Oesel Island [Oc- 
tober 19, 1944] and forced a withdrawal of the German de- 
fenders [October 23/24, 1944]. The German Latvian 

345 



beachhead was reduced in size by Russian attacks [Febru- 
ary 19-28, 1945 and March 3-14, 1945] but held out until 
the final German surrender [May 8, 1945]. The Red Army 
then announced that 146,000 German prisoners surrendered 
in the Latvian beachhead. 

On the Polish front the Russian armies advanced in Sep- 
tember to the Czechoslovakian frontier which was crossed 
[September 13, 1944] southwest of Przemysl. In central 
Poland troops of the First White Russian Army captured 
Praga [September 14, 1944] the eastern suburb of Warsaw. 
Here, despite the hopes of the Polish patriot forces which 
had risen in revolt under the leadership of General Bor 
(Lieutenant General Tadeusz Komorowski), the advance of 
the Russian armies halted after a frontal attack [Septem- 
ber 17, 1944] failed to take the city. General Bor surren- 
dered the Polish patriot army, which had been supplied by 
British and American planes, after sixty-three days of re- 
sistance [October 2, 1944]. 

The First Baltic Army launched an offensive toward the 
Baltic coast in Lithuania in October. This attack reached 
its objective sixteen miles north of Memel [October 10, 
1944]. Further attacks by the First Baltic Army extended 
the breakthrough until a 70-mile front was established on the 
Niemen River [October 23, 1944]. Memel was held by the 
Germans until late in January 1945. It was occupied by the 
Red Army [January 28, 1945]. In the meantime the main 
direction of Russian attacks had changed. 

East Prussia was invaded for the first time in the Second 
World War [October 19, 1944] when troops of the Third 
White Russian Army crossed the frontier below the Kaunas- 
Konigsberg railway. After capturing Goldap [October 23, 
1944] and Augustow [October 24, 1944], the line stabilized 
[November 5, 1944] after the Germans recaptured Goldap. 

The Campaign in Hungary 

Early in 1944 German troops occupied Hungary [March 
18-20, 1944], and Field Marshal Doeme Sztojay was set 
up as a Nazi puppet ruler. He was succeeded by Bela 
Imredy, another Nazi puppet. 

The withdrawal of Rumania and Bulgaria from the Axis 

346 



and their subsequent declarations of war on Germany 
radically changed the military situation on the southern 
front in September 1944. The Third Ukrainian Army in- 
vaded Yugoslavia and captured Belgrade [October 20, 
1944]. The Germans slowly retreated in the south in 
order to prolong the escape corridor for their forces in 
Greece and Yugoslavia. 

Aided by approximately 12 Rumanian divisions, the 
Fourth and Second Ukrainian Armies drove the Germans 
out of Transylvania [September 28-October 5, 1944] and 
crossed the Hungarian border east of Szeged [October 6, 
1944]. Continuing their advance, forward elements of the 
Second Ukrainian Army reached Baja on the Danube River 
84 miles south of Budapest [October 21, iP44]. After fluctu- 
ating battles in this area, the Red Army captured Also- 
Nemedi, ten miles from Budapest [N ovember 3, 1944]. The 
Germans put up a very stiff fight for the approaches to Buda- 
pest, and after the Russians had encircled the city, they 
fought a street-by-street battle which did not end until its 
complete capture [February 13, 1945]. As will be shown 
later, the Germans mounted their last great counteroffensive 
of the war in the Lake Balaton sector in an effort to relieve 
their forces in Hungary. 

Hungary made an effort to get out of the war [October 
15, 1944] when Regent Admiral Horthy appealed for an 
armistice. His appeal was renounced and he was overthrown 
by the pro-Fascist Red Arrow group under Ferenc Szalasy. 
Finally a Provisional Hungarian National Assembly was set 
up [December 21, 1944] at Debrecen. General Bela Miklos 
became Provisional Premier and appealed to the Russians 
for an armistice [December 30, 1944]. On the same day 
[December 30, 1944], the Provisional Hungarian Govern- 
ment declared war on Germany. Since Austria was a part of 
the Reich, this meant that Germany had lost all her former 
allies. 

II. THE GREAT RED WINTER OFFENSIVE 

The Drive in Central Poland 

The front in central Poland had been relatively stable 

347 



since the Red Army had reached the Vistula and captured 
Praga [September 14, 1944]. The major fighting on the 
Eastern Front in the late autumn and early winter of 1944- 
45 had taken place in Hungary. Meantime the Red Army 
prepared for a great drive from Poland into East Prussia and 
Silesia. This drive was launched [January 12, 1945] by 
five Russian armies or army groups, the First, Second, and 
Third White Russian, and the First and Fourth Ukrainian. 
At the outset of the offensive the front in the East ran 
approximately from Memel-Gumbinnen-Augustow-Narev 
River- Vistula River-Wisloka River to the Dukla Pass. 

After a tremendous artillery preparation [January 12, 
1945], the great Russian winter offensive began. Immedi- 
ate progress was made in the center. Warsaw was captured 
[January 17, 1945], and the First White Russian Army 
reached a position beyond Lodz [January 19, 1945] . Krakow 
was captured by the First Ukrainian Army on the same day 
[January 19, 1945]. 

The pattern of the Russian winter offensive was designed 
to exploit German weakness in the East. A drive toward 
Konigsberg was launched directly from the Gumbinnen area, 
while two spearheads were driven northward from Poland 
aimed at cutting off East Prussia in the Danzig-Elbing area. 
As was customary in German military planning, their strong- 
est resistance was offered on the northern and southern flanks 
of the Russian advance. Konigsberg was defended stub- 
bornly, and the Russian advance toward Elbing was slow 
and costly. But the Germans could not defend all areas. In 
the south the First Ukrainian Army broke through German 
defenses, crossed the Silesian border and captured Gross- 
Strehlitz [January 22, 1945]. Breslau was by-passed and 
under siege. The great German industrial area of Silesia was 
now directly threatened. The Oder River was reached by the 
First Ukrainian Army [January 23, 1945], and the follow- 
ing day [January 24, 1945] the industrial center of Oppeln 
fell into Russian hands. In the north the Second White Rus- 
sian Army fought its way around Grudziadz [January 28, 
1945] and captured Elbing after a street-by-street battle 
[January 26-February 7, 1945], German flank forces having 

348 



been pushed back, it was now possible for the Russian armies 
in the center to make great progress. 

Tremendous gains were made by the Russians in central 
Poland. The First White Russian Army advanced rapidly 
and by-passed Bydgoszcz, Poznan and Torun [January 26- 
27, 1945] where German garrisons held out for some time. 
The Germans reacted to these advances by withdrawing 
their Memel bridgehead [January 28, 1945] and by retreat- 
ing to Konigsberg, which came under close siege [January 
29-30, 1945]. Further spectacular advances of the First 
White Russian Army brought it to the Oder River [Febru- 
ary 2, 1945]. This advance was widened along the front 
Kiistrin-Frankfurt-Fijrstenberg [February 3-4, 1945] . Ber- 
lin was now only 45 miles distant from the Red Army 
Oder River positions. Early efforts of the Russians to cross 
the Oder in the Kustrin-Frankfurt area [February 5-6, 
1945] failed. It became evident that the Germans were mak- 
ing their final defense of the Reich on the Oder and Neisse 
River line. 

Preparations for the Final Assault on Berlin 

In something more than a month [January 12-February 
18, 1945], the Red Army had driven a tremendous salient 
into the Reich. The battle line now ran approximately from 
the Bay of Danzig at Elbing to Matawy-Chojnice-Ebers- 
walde-Kiistrin-Frankfurt-Crossen-Sagan-Namberg-Lan- 
dau-Oppeln. Grudziadz, Ponzon, Glogau, and Breslau were 
holding out behind the Russian lines, as was Konigsberg and 
the German beachhead in Latvia. After these great gains it 
was necessary for the Russians to widen the base of the 
salient before driving in on Berlin itself. 

Meantime in Hungary the German garrison at Budapest 
had finally surrendered [February 13, 1945]. Despite the 
fact that Berlin itself was menaced, the Germans stubbornly 
continued the fight in northern Hungary and prepared to 
launch their final counteroffensive of the war in that area. 

Operations of the Third and Second White Russian 
Armies in February and March were aimed at widening the 
salient in the north and effecting a new breakthrough to the 
Baltic Sea in the direction of Kolberg and Stettin. Russian 

349 



attacks beginning February 19, 1945, gradually narrowed 
the German hold on the Konigsberg-Danzig beachhead 
.which was completely isolated when the First White Russian 
^rmy reached Kolberg [February 26, 1945]. Kolberg it- 
self was not immediately captured by the Russians; it be- 
came another German "hedgehog" behind the advancing 
front. Neustettin was captured [February 28, 1945]; 
Grudziadz was reduced [March 6, 1945]; and Stolp was 
captured [March 9, 1945], On the Bay of Danzig the Rus- 
sian line reached Puck and the Hel Peninsula [March 18, 
1945.]. Stettin was und^r long-range attack and the battle 
front ran from the Gulf of Stettin along the Oder and Neisse- 
to the Hron River. 

The final German counteroffensives of the war were 
launched near Lake Balaton [March 5, 1945] in an effort to 
check the Red Army advance and possibly to recapture 
Budapest for prestige reasons. Some German gains were 
made northeast of Lake Balaton [March 5-15, 1945], but 
these advances were soon checked by Red Army attacks. The 
Third Ukrainian Army launched its own offensive [March 
23, 1945] north of Lake Balaton and broke through the 
German line. This was a major thrust and reached Szom- 
bathely [March 29, 1945]. The important industrial city of 
Wiener Neustadt fell to the Red Army [April 3, 1945], 
Without halting, the Third Ukrainian Army swung north- 
eastward and reached the Danube River at Klosterneuberg 
[April 7, 1945], encircling Vienna. Some pretense was put 
up by the Nazi Propaganda Ministry that Vienna would be 
defended street by street, but the German garrison thought 
otherwise. The defense collapsed [April 13, 1945] when 
remnants of the garrison surrendered. 

Meanwhile in the north Gdynia and Danzig surrendered 
[March 29, 1945], and Konigsberg was captured by the 
Second White Russian Army together with 92,000 German 
prisoners [April 9, 1945]. The stage was now set for the 
final Russian advance on Berlin. 

The Battle for Berlin 

According to an interview given to Associated Press corre- 
spondents in Berlin [June 10, 1945] after_the final victory, 

350 



Marshal Gregory K. Zhukov declared that the final battle 
for Berlin was won on the Oder front [April 15-16, 1945]. 
According to the Marshal, the Red Army massed 22,000 
guns and mortars in preparation for the final breakthrough. 
Five thousand planes flew 15,000 sorties in twenty-four 
hours preceding the attack which was launched at night 
\ April 15-16] on a wide front between KUstrin and Frank- 
furt. According to Marshal Zhukov's estimates, the Germans 
had concentrated half a million men to defend the Oder line. 

In four days of fighting [April 15-20, 1945] the German 
Oder front was destroyed and according to Russian accounts 
350,000 prisoners were taken. Troops of the First White 
Russian Army reached JiJterbog [April 20, 1945] and fight- 
ing began on the outskirts of Berlin [April 22, 1945]. The 
Elbe River was reached [April 23, 1945] near Meissen by 
elements of the First White Russian Army, and contact was 
made with patrols of the U. S. Ninth Army near Torgau 
[April 26, 1945]. 

While street fighting raged in the suburbs of Berlin, the 
First White Russian and the First Ukrainian Armies drew 
a steel trap around the city. It was closed [April 28, 
1945], despite counterattacks of the German Twelfth Army 
which had left the American front on the Elbe and had 
raced eastward to defend the capital of the Reich. 

Hitler's death was announced [May 1, 1945] by Grand 
Admiral Karl Doenitz over the Flensburg radio. This was a 
signal for the end. Remnants of the German Twelfth Army 
turned about face and attempted to reach the American lines 
in order to surrender. The Berlin garrison, some 130,000 
men, surrendered to the Russians [May 2, 1945] at 1500 
hours. The final act of surrender was signed in Berlin by 
Field Marshal Keitel [May 8, 1945]. 

Fighting continued in Czechoslovakia until May 11, 1945, 
when 374,000 German troops surrendered to the Americans 
and 26,000 to the Yugoslav forces. Breslau capitulated 
[May 7 , 1945]. The German garrisons on the Hel Peninsula 
north of Danzig and on the island of Bornholm obeyed the 
surrender decree signed by Field Marshal Keitel. About 
one million prisoners were taken on the Eastern Front in 
the final operations of the war. 

351 



German Casualties 

Final figures on German losses in the European war are 
not available. On account of the confusion existing in Ger- 
many at the end of the war losses may never be completely 
reported. A document captured in the home of General 
Hermann Reinecke of the Wehrmacht propaganda section 
set the German military losses to November 30, 1944, 
at 4,064,438 killed, wounded, and missing. Of these 1,709,- 
739 were listed as killed. German losses from November 30, 
1944, to the end of the war have been conservatively esti- 
mated at over 500,000. This would bring the German cas- 
ualty list to four and a half million. If the German prisoners 
taken by the Allied and Russian armies in the last days of 
the war are added, this accounts for seven and a half mil- 
lion men — approximately the total strength of the Wehr- 
macht and special troops. 



36. BREAKING JAPAN'S INNER DEFENSES 

I. OPERATIONS IN BURMA AND CHINA 

Opening the Ledo Road to Kunming 

After the capture of Myitkyina [August 3, 1945], Chinese 
and American forces in northern Burma pressed on toward 
the important road junction of Bhamo. Changes were made 
in the American command in the China-Burma-India Thea- 
ter. General Joseph W. Stilwell was recalled to Washington 
[October 28, 1944] and subsequently became Commander 
of Army Ground Forces. Lieutenant General Daniel I. Sultan 
became American commander in the Burma-India Theater. 
The American command in China was assumed by Major 
General (now Lieutenant General) Albert C. Wedemeyer. 

The basic plan of General Stilwell for opening a road from 
Ledo to Kunming remained in effect. The campaign in the 
north continued as Chinese troops captured Myothit, some 
87 miles south of Myitkyina [October 30, 1944]. Lungling 
was occupied [November 3, 1944], and the advance on 
Bhamo continued. After meeting strong initial resistance at 

352 



Bhamo, the Chinese 38th Division captured it [December 
15, 1944] after the Japanese suddenly withdrew their forces. 
There was a motor road running from Myitkyina to Bhamo. 
After it was repaired and put in condition for traffic, the 
Ledo Road was extended to a point where it joined the old 
Burma Road. 

After the fall of Bhamo, Japanese forces in the northern 
Shan States retreated to Namkham from which they were 
driven by Chinese troops [January 15, 1945]. There was 
only one more Japanese road block on the old Burma road a 
few miles north at Wanting. It was cleared by Chinese and 
American troops [January 17-18, 1945]. Troops of the 
Y Force operating from China cleared the Japs from the 
town of Mongyu [January 27, 1945] , and the route to Kun- 
ming was open. The first American truck convoy led by 
Brigadier General (now Major General) Lewis A. Pick, who 
built the Ledo Road, rolled into Kunming, China [February 
4, 1945]. The long isolation of China was ended. General- 
issimo Chiang Kai-shek renamed the Ledo-Burma Road 
''The Stilwell Road" in honor of General Stilwell. 

The British Offensives in Burma 

After the repulse of the Japanese offensives on the Arakan 
and Manipur fronts, the British Fourteenth Army under 
command of Lieutenant General Sir W. J. Slim assumed the 
offensive. Cooperating with the Chinese-American drive in 
the north, British troops captured Katha [December 16, 
1944]. 

Amphibious operations of the Indian XV Corps led to the 
occupation of Akyab [January 4, 1945] which the Japanese 
had abandoned. Ramree Island was occupied by troops of 
the Indian 26th Division [January 21-February 17, 1945]. 
At the beginning of 1945 it became apparent that the Jap- 
anese were withdrawing to the Irrawaddy River in an effort 
to shorten their lines. 

The British campaign to recapture Mandalay and Ran- 
goon began with the capture of Shwebo [January 9, 1945] 
by troops of the British IV Corps. Troops of the XXXIII 
Corps crossed the Irrawaddy River in force near Myinmu 
[February 26-March 3, 1945] and reached Awa Bridge 10 

353 



miles southwest of Mandalay \Marck 18, 1945]. The Indian 
19th Division left its bridgehead on the Irrawaddy River at 
Singan and reached the northern outskirts of Mandalay 
[March 8, 1945]. Farther south troops of the IV Corps cap- 
tured Meiktila [March 2, 1945] cutting Japanese communi- 
cations lines to the south. The Japanese put up a street-by- 
street battle for Mandalay [March 8-22, 1945]. Collapse 
of Japanese resistance came [March 22, 1945] with the cap- 
ture by the Indian 22nd Division of Fort Dufferin, the 
principal Japanese strongpoint. Mopping up operations con- 
tinued in the Mandalay area for some time. 

Rangoon, the principal port of Burma, fell to elements of 
the British IV Corps [May 2-4, 1945]. Very little Japanese 
resistance was encountered and it now became clear that 
the enemy was withdrawing his forces across the Sittang 
River. Pockets of Japanese resistance near Pegu continued 
to give trouble, but the major campaign was over. Lord 
Louis Mountbatten announced [May 4, 1945] that the 
Japanese had suffered 347,000 casualties (of which 97,000 
were counted dead) in Burma and that the campaign was 
at an end. Several thousand additional Japanese troops 
were killed on the Sittang River front before the Japanese 
surrender. 

The Japanese Offensives in China, 1944 

The only theater in which Japanese forces were on the 
offensive in 1944 was China. Here they undertook opera- 
tions designed to gain control of the remaining railway line 
running south from Hankow to Canton. They also mounted 
offensives in Hunan, Kwangsi, Kwangtung, and Kiangsi 
Provinces to destroy the forward bases of the U. S. Four- 
teenth Air Force. In effect their objectives were defensive in 
character. They wished to protect their own shipping and 
coastal installations from the damaging attacks of the Four- 
teenth Air Force, and they wished to secure an inland route of 
supply to or retreat from their bases in Indo-China, Malaya, 
and Burma. As American air and sea power reduced the 
strength and operating zone of the Japanese Navy, they 
might eventually lose control of the China Sea. 

The first major Japanese attack came southward along 

354 



the Hanchow railway toward Hengyang which was captured 
[August 8, 1944]. From Hengyang drives were mounted 
against the American air bases in Hunan, Kwangsi, and 
Kiangsi Provinces. At the same time drives based on Canton 
aimed at American airbases in Kwangtung and Kwangsi 
Provinces. Japanese landing parties captured the coastal 
cities of Wenchow [September 20, 1944] and Foochow [Oc- 
tober 5, 1944]. It was apparent that a concerted Japanese 
effort was under way to discourage war-weary China, and 
protect herself against possible further reverses in other 
theaters. 

Under the threat of multiple Japanese columns, one 
American airbase after another in southeastern China had 
to be abandoned. The Japanese advance from Hengyang 
forced the abandonment of Lingling [September 8, 1944] 
and of the great base at Kweilin [September 17, 1944]. Wu- 
chow was destroyed by the U. S. Fourteenth Air Force [Sep- 
tember 22, 1944] ; Tanchuk was abandoned [November 1, 
1944] ; Luichow and Kweiping were evacuated [October 
10-13, 1944]. Nanning fell to the Japanese [November 26, 
.1944] . Japanese columns operating out of Nanning met col- 
umns advancing from Indo-China [December 10, 1944], 
completing a Japanese-dominated route from Korea to 
Malaya. 

Throughout all these operations the ill-equipped Chinese 
forces continued to resist the Japanese, and despite the loss 
of their forward bases the Fourteenth Air Force maintained 
constant pressure on the Japanese lines of communications 
and shipping. Major General Claire Chennault reported that 
as of February 1945 the Fourteenth Air Force had destroyed 
2,194 Japanese planes, sunk 409 vessels of 859,000 tons, and 
damaged 169 vessels of 670,000 tons. China was painfully 
hurt by the losses of 1944 but she did not waver in her prose- 
cution of the war. 

Chinese Offensives in 1945 

China's armies assumed the offensive on the southern front 
in the spring of 1945 and throughout the summer steadily 
reduced the Japanese hold on former American airbases and 
on certain coastal cities. They fought their way into Foo- 

355 



chow [May 13, 1945] only to be driven out [May 17, 1945]. 
They recaptured Diongbh [May 20, 1945], Hochih and 
Mamoi [May 21, 1945] . The first American airbase in south- 
ern China to be recaptured was Nanning which fell [May 
27, 1945]. 

At the end of May 1945 Lieutenant General Albert C. 
Wedemeyer said ti'at the Allies were passing from the de- 
Censive to the offensive and that he was "very optimistic 
concerning future military developments in China." Wen- 
chow was captured by Chinese troops [June 19, 1945], 
and Luichow fell [June 22-30, 1945]. A Chinese drive on 
the great American airbase at Kweilin began in July. Ping- 
siang was captured [July 6, 1945] and Tanchuk fell into 
Chinese hands [July 9, 1945] . As the Chinese drive neared 
Kweilin it threatened to wipe out the main Japanese gains 
made in 1944. 

II. RECONQUEST OF THE PHILIPPINES 

Invasion of the Palaus 

An American return to the Philippines had long been the 
dream of General Douglas MacArthur and the troops of the 
U. S. Sixth Army (General Walter Krueger) under his com- 
mand. With this objective in view they had fought their 
way from Australia up the coast of New Guinea. With this 
objective in mind the fleets and forces of Admiral Nimitz 
had fought their way through Jap strongholds in the Central 
Pacific and were firmly entrenched in the Marianas. There 
remained barring the route to the Philippines only the Jap- 
anese forces in the New Guinea-Halmahera group and strong 
Japanese garrisons in the Palaus. Against these barriers both 
forces moved in September 1944. 

Operations of the Southwest Pacific Command looking for- 
ward to an invasion of the Philippines began [September 
7, 1944] when landings were made on Soepiori Island off 
Biak in Geelvink Bay. Eight days later [September 15, 
1944] troops of the 31st Infantry Division and the 126th 
Infantry Regiment of the 32nd Division under command 
of Major General John C. Persons landed on the southwest- 
ern coast of Morotai, the northernmost island of the Halma- 

356 



hera group. Conquest of these areas gave the Sixth Army 
airbases from which to dominate the approaches to the 
Phihppines. 

The attack on the Palaus began with a bombardment by 
units of the U. S. Third Fleet [September 6-7, 1944]. After 
heavy bombardment and repeated air strikes, troops of the 
1st Marine Division (Major General William H. Rupertus) 
landed on the southwestern shore of Peleliu Island [Septem- 
ber 15, 1944] . Strong Japanese resistance was encountered 
and progress was slow. Especially severe fighting raged 
around "Bloody Nose Ridge" where Japanese troops were 
sheltered in caves and pillboxes. 

Two days after the initial landing on Peleliu, troops of the 
U. S. 81st Infantry Division (Major General Paul J. Muel- 
ler) landed on Angaur Island [September 17, 1944] and 
crushed all organized Japanese resistance in three days. 
Thereafter, until the end of organized Japanese resistance on 
Peleliu [October 13, 1944], 81st Division troops cooperated 
in the conquest of that island. They also occupied the small 
island of Garakayo [October 11, 1944]. Ngesebus and Kon- 
gauru, two small islands in the Palau group, were occupied 
without resistance by Marine troops [September 28, 1944]. 
Organized fighting ceased in the Palaus [October 13, 1944], 
although small numbers of Japs infested the islands for some 
time and mopping-up operations went on for several weeks. 
Total Marine and Army casualties in the Palau operations to 
October 9, 1944, were given as 1,105 killed, 6,439 wounded, 
and 245 missing. Japanese casualties amounted to 11,380 
killed and 228 captured. 

Preliminary Air Strikes and Fleet Operations 

Liberators of the Far Eastern Air Force began the attack 
on Mindanao Island [September 1-2, 1944]. Carrier-plane 
strikes of the U. S. Third Fleet on the Mindanao area [Sep- 
tember 9, 1944] sank or damaged 89 Japanese vessels and 
destroyed 68 enemy planes. Attacks of the Third Fleet car- 
rier planes extended to Cebii, Negros, and Panay Islands in 
the Central Philippines [September 12-14, 1944]. In these 
operations 156 Japanese planes were destroyed in combat 
and 277 on the ground. Eighty-four enemy vessels were sunk 

357 



or damaged. Task Force 58, commanded by Vice Admiral 
Marc A. Mitscher, joined in the pre-invasion assault on the 
Philippines. In a series of bold raids on Japanese shipping in 
Manila Bay [September 21-22, 1944] and on airfields 
around the capital, 103 Japanese ships were sunk or damaged 
and 405 enemy planes were destroyed or damaged. Switch- 
ing their attack to the Central Philippines [September 24, 
1944] planes of Task Force 58 sank 21 more Japanese ships 
and destroyed 36 enemy planes. 

In October planes of the U. S. Third Fleet took over the 
job of keeping Japanese air power checked in the Philippines, 
while Task Force 58 steamed northward in a diversionary 
stroke at Formosa. Planes of the Third Fleet attacked Japan- 
ese airfields in Luzon [October 14-17, 1944]. Japanese 
feeder airfields on Formosa were struck by planes of Task 
Force 58 [October 12-14, 1944]. Admiral Mitscher's flyers 
had a rich haul on Formosa. They destroyed 437 Japanese 
aircraft and sank or damaged 113 Japanese vessels. The 
Japanese fleet took one look at Mitscher's armada off For- 
mosa and fled. The Japanese propaganda machine covered 
this retreat by manufacturing a fake naval engagement off 
Formosa [October 16-17 , 1944] in which they claimed the 
"annihilation of Task Force 58." 

The American pre-invasion air attacks on the Philippines 
were more successful than the first reports indicated. After 
we had recaptured most of the islands, General George C. 
Kenney, commander of the Far East Air Force, declared 
that wrecks of nearly 3,000 Japanese planes littered the air- 
fields of the Philippines. With Japanese air power in the 
Philippines reduced to a remnant, the American invasion was 
ready to begin. 

Invasion of Leyte 

The invasion of Leyte Island in the Philippines was car- 
ried out [October 21, 1944] by the U. S. Sixth Army, con- 
sisting of the X Corps (Major General Franklin C. Sibert) 
and the XXIV Corps (Lieutenant General John R. Hodge). 
The U. S. Seventh Fleet (Vice Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid) 
was under the direct control of General (now General of the 

358 



Army) Douglas MacArthur. The U. S. Third Fleet (Admiral 
William F. Halsey, Jr.) operated in direct support. 

After a heavy bombardment carried out by the fleet, the 
X Corps (24th Infantry Division and 1st Cavalry Division) 
landed south of Tacloban. The XXIV Corps (7th and 96th 
Infantry Divisions) landed near Dulag. A secure beachhead 
was established on both fronts by the night of October 21st, 
and troops moved inland aiming at a juncture. One combat 
team of the XXIV Corps landed on Panaon Island just south 
of Leyte. The two American beachheads on Leyte were 
joined [October 25, 1944], and troops pushed inland against 
light opposition by the Japanese 16th Division. 

Troops of the 1st Cavalry Division invaded Samar Island 
and secured solid footholds on both sides of San Juanico 
Strait [October 30, 1944]. Samar Island was found to be 
without a Japanese garrison and its occupation was accom- 
plished with little difficulty. By the end of October the Leyte 
plain extending from Carigara to Dulag had been occupied 
by American troops. It appeared that the end of the cam- 
paign for Leyte was in sight. The Japanese high command, 
however, determined to reinforce the Leyte garrison, and a 
long-drawn-out battle for control of the island followed. Ad- 
ditional American units sent to Leyte included the 32nd 
Infantry Division, the 77th and 38th Infantry Divisions, the 
Americal Division, the 11th Airborne Division, the 112th 
Cavalry Regimental Combat Team, the 503rd Parachute In- 
fantry Regiment, the 20th Armored Group, and the 1st 
Filipino Infantry. 

Naval Battles off the Philippines 

The American invasion of the Philippines presented the 
Japanese Navy with a challenge that could not be ignored. 
Japanese spokesmen had long insisted that the Philippines 
were of decisive importance to a Japanese victory. If the 
American invasion was successful, Japanese communications 
to Indo-China, Malaya, and the Netherlands East Indies 
would be cut. The Japanese Navy as well as the Army was 
largely dependent on oil shipments from the Indies. It was 
a case of fight now or never. On October 23, 1944, the Japan- 
ese fleet steamed forth to give battle. A series of naval en- 

359 



gagements [October 23-26, 1944] known as the Battle of 
Leyte Gulf followed. Three almost simultaneous engage- 
ments, called: the Battle of Surigao Strait, the Battle off 
Samar, and the Battle off Cape Engaiio, took place as the 
Japanese attempted to strike at American transports in the 
Leyte Gulf area and destroy supporting American fleet units. 

The Japanese fleet moved out in three columns. One (the 
southern force) entered Surigao Strait, one column (the 
central force) passed through the San Bernardino Strait, 
another (the northern force) moved southward from bases 
in the home islands. They converged on Leyte Gulf October 
25. 

American submarines and patrol planes had spotted the 
Japanese approach [October 23, 1944] and two heavy 
cruisers were sunk by the submarines Darter and Dace. Two 
additional cruisers were damaged by air attacks during the 
approach period. 

Battle of Surigao Strait 

The Japanese southern force consisting of two battleships, 
one heavy cruiser, and four destroyers entered Surigao Strait 
in the early hours of October 25, 1944. Rear Admiral (now 
Vice Admiral) J. B. Oldendorff, in tactical command of the 
U. S. Seventh Fleet units, stationed his forces so that the 
enemy was struck first by our PT boats, then by destroyer 
torpedo attacks, and finally as they reached the northern end 
of the Strait their battle line was met with our heavy cruisers 
and battleships. Admiral Oldendorff accomplished what few 
naval officers achieve in a lifetime of professional service — 
crossing the enemy's T. Before the Japanese could extricate 
themselves from their predicament they lost two battleships 
and three destroyers. The Jap heavy cruiser was sunk the 
following day by American planes. Thus almost the whole 
Japanese southern force was annihilated. The only damage 
sustained by Admiral Oldendorff's force was inflicted on the 
destroyer Albert W. Grant by Japanese gunfire. 

Battle Off Samar 

The Japanese central force heading for the Strait of San 
Bernardino consisted of 5 battleships, 8 cruisers, and 13 de- 

360 



stroyers. It was attacked [October 24, 1944] by carrier 
planes of the U. S. Third Fleet as it passed through Mindoro 
Strait. These attacks sank the new Japanese battleship 
Musashi, one cruiser and one destroyer. Damage must have 
been inflicted on other units of the central force because 
when it reached the eastern coast of Samar the force con- 
tained only 4 battleships, 5 cruisers, and 1 1 destroyers. This 
still powerful fleet fell upon a group of six American escort 
carriers, three destroyers and four destroyer escorts under 
Rear Admiral C. A. F. Sprague. Planes of the American car- 
riers sank one enemy heavy cruiser and one destroyer, but 
in the surface engagements which followed the U. S. escort 
carrier Gambler Bay, the destroyers Hoel and Johnston and 
the destroyer escort Roberts were sunk by enemy gunfire. 
Damage by gunfire was inflicted on the escort carriers White 
Plains and Kitkun Bay and the escort carriers Suwanee and 
Santee. Enemy Kamikazes sank the escort carrier Saint Ld 
on the morning of October 25. 

The strange thing about the Battle off Samar was that 
the Japanese fleet broke off the engagement after pounding 
the relatively weak American escort canier force, ignored the 
American transports in Leyte Gulf, and retired through San 
Bernardino Strait. Here they were pursued by planes from 
Admiral Sprague's remaining carriers and by planes of the 
Third Fleet. Two additional enemy heavy cruisers and one 
destroyer were sunk as a result of American air attacks 
[October 25-26, 1944], while battleships sank one cruiser. 

Battle Off Cape Engano 

The Japanese northern force consisting of 1 large and 3 
light carriers, 2 battleships with flight decks, 5 cruisers, and 
6 destroyers was discovered by American search planes 
[October 24, 1944] to be heading in the direction of the 
Philippines. Since this was the only Japanese force which in- 
cluded carriers. Admiral Halsey moved the Third Fleet car- 
rier force to the attack. The first strike took place on the 
morning of October 25 at 0840 hours. Thereafter until 1800 
hours our carrier planes struck repeatedly at the Japanese 
northern force. Cripples were finished off by American cruis- 
ers and destroyers. At the end of the day the Japanese north- 

361 



ern force had lost four carriers, a light cruiser, and a 
destroyer. Damage had been inflicted on the Japanese battle- 
ships and other units. 

Admiral Halsey then turned southward with most of his 
force before noon to relieve the hard-pressed ships of Admiral 
Sprague. Planes of the Third Fleet joined in the attack on the 
retreating Japanese central force, inflicting loss and damage 
on the remaining Japanese vessels. 

The Battle of Leyte Gulf was an overwhelming American 
victory. The only American heavy unit lost was the fast car- 
rier Princeton. The Japanese Navy suffered such heavy losses 
and damage as to be reduced to virtually "task force size." 
After that battle the Japanese fleet never attempted to inter- 
fere with an American landing operation except for the ill- 
fated cruise of the battleship Yamato in Okinawa waters. 

Campaign on Leyte 

By the end of October 1944 the Japanese had been driven 
from all of southern and northeastern Leyte with an esti- 
mated loss of 24,000 men. Instead of relinquishing Leyte, the 
Japanese high command decided to fight for it and sent in 
portions of the Japanese Thirty-fourth Army identified as 
the 1st, 30th, and 102nd Divisions under command of Gen- 
eral Tomoyuki Yamashita. These reinforcements were 
shipped into Leyte via the port of Ormoc and their presence 
soon became felt on the northern front where both the X 
and XXIV Corps encountered strong opposition. 

The general American plan of attack was centered around 
operations of the X Corps in the north and the XXIV Corps 
in the south. The 24th Infantry and 1st Cavalry Divisions 
had tough going in the difficult terrain near Pinamopoan, and 
the U. S. 32nd Division was sent in to reinforce that front. 
The U. S. 7th Division was facing- strong Japanese opposi- 
tion south of Albuera and the 77th Infantry Division was 
earmarked for support in that area. 

Japanese air activity increased on the Leyte front as 
new planes were brought in to neighboring islands. Suicide 
attacks were made on American shipping in Leyte Gulf 
[November 15-December 7, 1944]. Japanese paratroops 

362 



were landed on American airstrips near Tacloban [Decem- 
ber 7, 1944] in an attempt to destroy planes and disrupt 
our air operations. 

A general advance on the X Corps front in the direction of 
Limon began [November 15, 1944] . Slow progress was made 
against strong opposition. The attack of the U. S. 7th Divi- 
sion in the south which made steady but slow progress 
against Albuera was suddenly aided by the landing of the 
U. S. 77th Infantry Division three miles south of Ormoc 
[Decmber 6-7, 1944]. 

The amphibious operation of the 77th Division must have 
surprised the Japanese command for they attempted to bring 
in several transports in Ormoc Bay at the same time as the 
American landing. Six Japanese transports laden with troops 
and supplies were sunk by our Navy on the night of [Decem- 
ber 6-7, 1944]. Three additional transports were sunk 
northwest of Leyte [December 12, 1944], as the Japanese 
persisted in their attempts to reinforce Leyte. 

Ormoc was captured by the 77th Division [December 11, 
1944] and a junction was made on the same day with troops 
of the 7th Division which captured Albuera [December 10, 
1944]. Advancing northward from Ormoc, the 77th Division 
captured Cogon [December 16, 1944] and occupied Valencia 
[December 19, 1944]. Junction was made with troops of the 
1st Cavalry Division which had moved southward and cap- 
tured Kananga [December 20, 1944]. In one of the final 
operations of the campaign, the 77th Division made an 
amphibious hop to Palompon on Christmas Day. Organized 
Japanese resistance was officially announced at an end [De- 
cember 26, 1944]. Mopping up operations, however, con- 
tinued for many weeks on Leyte. 

Total Japanese losses on Leyte were estimated at 54,833 
killed and 493 prisoners. American losses were 2,623 killed, 
8,422 wounded, and 172 missing. 

Invasion of Mindoro 

Before the campaign on Leyte had reached an end, troops 
of the Western Visayan Task Force of the 24th Infantry 
Division and the 503d Parachute Infantry Regiment invaded 
Mindoro. In a brilliant movement, by-passing Japanese 

363 



troops on Panay, Cebii, Mindanao, and Negros, General 
MacArthur sent a convoy to the southwestern coast of 
Mindoro where troops landed [December 15, 1944] . Advanc- 
ing inland against very light opposition, they secured the air- 
strip near San Jose [December 16, 1944]. When this air- 
strip was repaired and enlarged it afforded bases for planes 
covering the invasion of Luzon. 

Invasion of Luzon 

Leyte and Mindoro were but preliminaries to the great 
invasion of Luzon. It was on the island of Luzon that the 
American and Philippine Army had gone down to defeat in 
1942. Luzon is the largest island of the Philippine group 
and seat of the capital. General MacArthur gave an ironical 
twist to the invasion by deciding to strike by the same route 
which the Japanese had used in 1941-42. His invasion 
armada steamed into Lingayen Gulf [January 6, 1945]. 
After three days bombardment by the fleet, troops of the 
Sixth Army landed [January 9, 1945] . They encountered un- 
expectedly little opposition and penetrated inland for seven 
miles [January 11, 1945]. The first serious Japanese resist- 
ance was met at Rosario [January 11, 1945] . By January 14 
a firm American beachhead was established from Damortis 
on the east to Port Saul on the west. 

Order of Battle in the Luzon Campaign 

The order of battle of the U. S. Army in the first stages of 
the Luzon campaign was given in public sources as follows: 

The U. S. Sixth Army, Lieutenant General (now General) 
Walter Krueger. 

I Corps, Major General Innis P. Swift 

6th Infantry Division, Major General Edwin D. Pat- 
rick (Charles E. Hurdis) 
43rd Infantry Division, Major General Leonard F. 

Wing 
25th Infantry Division, Major General Charles L. 

Mullins 
32nd Infantry Division, Major General W. H. Gill 
364 



XIV Corps, Major General (now Lieutenant General) 
Oscar W. Griswold 
37th Infantry Division, Major General Robert S. 

Beightler 
40th Infantry Division, Major General Rapp Brush 
1st Cavalry Division, Major General Verne D. Mudge 
33rd Infantry Division, Major General P. W. Clarkson 
11th Airborne Division, Major General Joseph M. Swing 

Early operations on Luzon showed that the Japanese were 
not prepared to defend the central plain but were retreating 
to the mountains north and east of Rosario. There they put 
up a savage fight against the I Corps. Finding the central 
plain practically without Japanese defenders, the XIV Corps 
made rapid progress toward Manila. They reached Paniqui 
37 miles inland [January 18, 1945]. Japanese forces in cen- 
tral Luzon retreated to the Zambales Mountains on the west 
and into the lower reaches of the Sierra Madre Mountains 
on the east. 

Advance on Manila 

On January 18, 1945, the U. S. I Corps occupied a 
line running from Rosario-Pozorrubbio-Binalonan-Urda- 
neta. The XIV Corps was developed in the area Paniqui- 
Santa Ignacia-Zambales Mountains to Balinao. The south- 
ward advance of the XIV Corps met with little resistance and 
reached Tarlac [January 20, 1945]. Fort Stotsenburg and 
Clark Field were reached [January 25, 1945]. Japanese 
troops which had retreated to the Zambales Mountains west 
of Fort Stotsenburg opened artillery fire on Clark Field 
after it came into American hands. The U. S. 40th Division 
was detailed to deal with these forces and the advance on 
Manila was resumed. Angeles was occupied by troops of the 
XIV Corps [January 28, 1945]. Manila seemed open to at- 
tack from the north. 

Meanwhile units of the XI Corps (Lieutenant General 
Charles P. Hall) of the newly announced U. S. Eighth Army, 
commanded by Lieutenant General Robert L. Eichelberger, 
landed on the Zambales coast between San Narciso and San 
Antonio [January 29, 1945] with a mission to drive forward 

365 



to the Subic Bay area and thence across the Bataan Penin- 
sula to the northern shore of Manila Bay. The XIV Corps 
reached San Fernando [January 29, 1945]. The Rio Grande 
de la Pampanga was reached [January 31, 1945] at Calum- 
pit and crossed by the XIV Corps on the following day. 

In order to cut off Manila from the south, the U. S. 11th 
Airborne Division (then operating under the Eighth Army) 
was landed at Nasugbu in Batangas Province 50 miles 
southwest of Manila [January 31, 1945]. A race for the 
honor of entering Manila developed between the 37th In- 
fantry Division which reached Bocaue fifteen miles from 
Manila [February 3, 1945] and the 1st Cavalry Division 
which reached Bustos on the same day. Both divisions 
reached the outskirts of Manila [February 4, 1945]. The 1st 
Cavalry Division immediately pushed into the city and freed 
3,700 American prisoners in Santo Tomas University. They 
reached the northern bank of the Pasig River in the San 
Miguel district of Manila late that night. Advance of the 
11th Airborne Division was held up by stubborn Japanese 
resistance south of Manila near Nichols Field. Under the 
cover of fires set in the city, Japanese troops withdrew be- 
yond the Pasig River. There they elected to fight to the 
death. At the end of the first month of the Luzon campaign 
Japanese losses were estimated at 48,000. American losses 
were 1,600 killed, 5,276 wounded and 191 missing. 

Clearing the Manila Area 

Up to February 8, 1945, it appeared that the capture of 
Manila would be a relatively easy task. The Japanese com- 
mander, however, had deliberately withdrawn his troops 
into the southern section of the city and it was necessary to 
blast and burn them out yard by yard. The bitterest kind of 
fighting raged in the Intramuros, the port, and residential 
sections south of the Pasig River as the 37th Infantry, 11th 
Airborne, and 1st Cavalry Divisions closed in upon the 
Japanese defenders. It was a long-drawn-out struggle last- 
ing from February 8 to 24, 1945. 

While this siege went on, other operations were conducted 
to free the Manila Bay area from Japanese troops. The 
U. S. 6th and 25th Infantry Divisions pushed forward on 

366 



the eastern flank, capturing Munoz, Rizal, and Lupszo [Feb- 
ruary 8, 1945]. Elements of the 6th Division broke loose 
on a long dash and reached the eastern coast of Luzon near 
Baler in Baler Bay [February 12, 1945]. Cavite naval 
base was occupied by troops of the 11th Airborne Division 
[February 13, 1945]. Fort McKinley was attacked by ele- 
ments of the 11th Airborne Division [February 14, 1945] 
and fell after five days of fighting [February 19, 1945]. 

Troops of the U. S. 38th Infantry Division, commanded 
by Major General William C. Chase, landed in Mariveles 
Bay, Bataan Peninsula [February 15, 1945] and after mop- 
ping up Japanese resistance made a junction with troops of 
the XI Corps advancing from Subic Bay. Corregidor was 
invaded [February 16, 1945] by troops of the 503rd Para- 
chute Infantry Regiment followed by landings from the sea 
by troops of the 34th Infantry Regiment. After six days of 
fighting the Japanese garrison on Corregidor was officially 
announced as being "practically destroyed." Twenty-three 
hundred Japanese dead were counted on Corregidor and 
many more were buried under the rubble of their pillboxes 
and caves. Japanese resistance in Manila was announced as 
at an end [February 24, 1945]. Twelve thousand Japanese 
dead were counted and great sections of the city were in 
ruins. A few Japanese suicide garrisons held out in such 
places as Caballo Island and Fort Drum, but they were 
burned out by pumping thousands of gallons of diesel fuel 
and gasoline into their defenses and setting fire to it. Caballo 
Island was thus reduced [April 3-5, 1945] and Fort Drum's 
concrete battleship was destroyed [April 14, 1945] by troops 
of the 2nd Engineer Special Brigade and by the 38th In- 
fantry Division. 

Freeing American and Filipino Prisoners on Luzon 

One of the most satisfying aspects of the Luzon campaign 
was the fact that it enabled the U. S. Army to set free many 
American and Filipino prisoners long held by the Japanese. 
A force of 121 American rangers and 286 Philippine Scouts 
made a daring foray 25 miles inside the Japanese lines in 
eastern Luzon to free 513 prisoners from the Cabanatuan 
prison camp near Cabu [January 30, 1945]. The rescue 

367 



force, from the 6th Ranger Battalion led by Lieutenant Col- 
onel Henry A. Mucci, killed 532 Japanese during the opera- 
tion. 

Reference has already been made to the freeing of Amer- 
ican and Filipino prisoners at Santo Tomas University [Feb- 
ruary 7 , 1945]. A bold operation by American airborne and 
infantry troops aided by Filipino guerrillas freed 2,146 ci- 
vilian prisoners from their prison camp at Los Bafios, 35 
miles south of Manila [February 23, 1945]. Two hundred 
and forty Japanese guards were killed. On April 18 about 
7,000 civilians, mostly Filipinos, were freed in the Baguio 
area. 

Operations in Central Luzon 

The plan of the Japanese high command apparently was 
based upon a recognition of their inability to meet the 
American Army in force on the Luzon Plain. They avoided 
a decisive engagement with the Sixth and Eighth Armies 
and fought individual delaying actions on many fronts. Only 
in the north where the U. S. I Corps battled its slow way 
against strong Japanese forces and through some of the most 
heavily fortified mountain and hill positions in the Philip- 
pines did operations follow an orthodox pattern. The ap- 
proximate front of the I Corps ran from Aringay-Rosario- 
Carranglan to Baler Bay. 

There was a considerable pocket of Japanese troops holed 
up in the Zambales Mountains west of Fort Stotsenburg, and 
these troops were gradually wiped out by elements of the 
40th, 43rd, and 38th Infantry Divisions. 

East of Manila Japanese troops in considerable numbers 
occupied positions in the Marikina Valley and they occa- 
sionally shelled Manila from positions in the foothills. Oper- 
ations against these forces were already under way by ele- 
ments of the 6th Infantry Division. Montalban was captured 
by the 6th Division [February 25, 1945], but Antipolo held 
out against the 1st Cavalry Division until March 10, 1945. 
The U. S. 43rd Division relieved the 1st Cavalry Division 
[March 14, 1945] and captured Teresa [March 17, 1945]. 
The Japanese then withdrew into the San Mateo Mountains. 
Tanay was occupied by the 6th Infantry Division [March 

368 



19, 1945] and slow progress continued toward Bosoboco. 
In April the 43rd Division moved around the north side of 
Laguna de Bay [April 6, 1945], and met troops of the 1st 
Cavalry Division moving up from the south at Lumban. Ipo 
Dam, the principal source of Manila's water supply, and 
northern anchor of the Japanese Shimbu Line east of Ma- 
nila, was captured [May 18, 1945], after more than a month 
of fighting. Wawa Dam and the remaining defenses of the 
Shimbu Line were captured [May 28, 1945]. Santa Ines, 
22) miles northeast of Manila, was captured [June 12, 1945]. 
All organized Japanese resistance in central Luzon ended 
[June 28, 1945]. 

Clearing Southern Luzon 

Japanese resistance in southern Luzon was wiped out in 
March and April. From the town of Taal the 158th Regi- 
mental Combat Team [March 8, 1945] moved south in the 
direction of Cuinca and Batangas. It was relieved [March 
27, 1945] by elements of the 11th Airborne Division which, 
with troops of the 1st Cavalry Division, had moved south 
from the Lake Taal area on Tanauan. -The 158th Regimental 
Combat Team entered Legaspi [Api'il 1, 1945], and part of 
its 2d Battalion landed at Sorgoson on the southern tip of 
Luzon [April 6, 1945], while the 11th Airborne Division, 
after occupying San Pablo [April 1, 1945], landed at Lucena 
[April 6, 1945]. The 1st Cavalry and the 11th Airborne Di- 
visions advanced to the line Lucban-Tayabas-Lucena 
[April 8, 1945]. Atimonan was captured [April 10, 1945]. 
Calauag on the east coast of the Bicol Peninsula was taken 
by the 11th Airborne Division after a 30-mile hop [April 12, 
1945]. This about ended resistance on southern Luzon. 

Operations in Northern Luzon 

Stubborn Japanese resistance met all efforts of the U. S. 
I Corps to advance northward toward Baguio. The U. S. 
33rd and 37th Infantry Divisions attacked from Rosario in 
the direction of Baguio. The U. S. 32nd and 25th Infantry 
Divisions attacked along the Villa Verde Trail and Route 
No. 5. Balete Pass, one of the main Japanese defenses along 
this route, was captured [May 15, 1945] by the 25th Divi- 
sion and one regiment of the 37th Division. The intensity of 

369 



the fighting in this area can be judged by the fact that it 
required 25 days for the American troops to fight their way 
forward two miles. Filipino guerrillas now came to the aid 
of the American troops in spectacular fashion. 

Infanta and Misua, two towns on the eastern coast of 
Luzon, were captured by Filipino guerrillas [May 23, 1945]. 
Santa Fe, guarding the entrance into the Cagayan Valley, 
was captured by American troops [May 27, 1945]. Aritao, 
ten miles north of Santa Fe, fell [June 6, 1945], and Bayom- 
bong was captured [June 7, 1945]. Bababag was entered 
after a nine-mile advance [June 10, 1945], and Orioung Pass 
was captured [June 13, 1945]. 

The slow grinding advance of the I Corps up the Cagayan 
Valley now began to produce big results. With Filipino 
guerrillas operating ever more openly in the north, the rem- 
nants of the Japanese Fourteenth Army, numbering around 
20,000 men, were now trapped in the Cagayan Valley. A 22- 
mile advance was made by troops of the I Corps [June 15, 
1945], freeing the towns of Santiago and Echague. Ipil, the 
first Jap airstrip to be captured in northern Luzon, fell to 
American troops [June 16, 1945]. Ilagan, the capital of Isa- 
bela Province, was occupied [June 19, 1945]. Japanese 
forces in northern Luzon were split into two parts [June 20, 
1945] as Filipino guerrillas crossed the Cagayan River and 
occupied Tuguegarao, capital of Cagayan Province. 

The north-south squeeze on the Japanese troops in the 
Cagayan Valley developed [June 21, 1945], as Filipino 
guerrillas and troops of the U. S. 11th Airborne Division 
captured Aparri, the last Jap escape port on Luzon. Lal-lo, 
11 miles south of Aparri, was captured by the 11th Airborne 
Division [June 24, 1945]. Junction was made [June 28, 
1945] between troops of the 37th Division moving north- 
ward and the 11th Airborne Division. This junction split the 
remaining Japanese forces into three parts. 

General Douglas MacArthur announced [July 5, 1945] 
that the entire Philippine Islands were liberated and that the 
Philippine campaign could be regarded as "virtually closed." 
He estimated that 23 Japanese divisions were "practically 
annihilated" in the Philippines by 17 American divisions 
and their Filipino comrades. It was estimated that the Japa- 

370 



nese Army lost over 400,000 men in the Philippines. Isolated 
pockets of Japanese were still resisting in certain sections of 
northern Luzon and Panay at the end of the war. 

Occupying Smaller Islands 

Japanese resistance on the smaller islands of the Philip- 
pine group varied. On some such as Palawan and Cebu small 
pockets of Japanese troops resisted for considerable periods. 
On others there was little or no resistance. 

Verde Island was occupied by units of the 24th Infantry 
Division [February 26, 1945]. 

Lubang Island was occupied by American troops [March 
2, 1945]. 

Palawan Island was invaded by the 41st Infantry Division 
[March 1-2, 1945] near Puerto Princesa. 

Romblon and Simara Islands were occupied [March 11, 
1945]. 

Basilan, the northernmost island of the Sulu Archipelago, 
was occupied by American troops [March 18, 1945]. The 
near-by island of Malamaui was occupied on the following 
day [March 19, 1945]. 

Panay Island was invaded by elements of the U. S. 40th 
Infantry Division [March 18, 1945]. The principal town of 
Iloilo was occupied [March 20, 1945]. Guimaras Island off 
Iloilo was occupied [March 22, 1945]. 

Cebii Island was invaded by troops of the Americal Divi- 
sion [March 26, 1945] . Cebu City was captured [March 27, 
1945], but pockets of Japanese resistance held out on the 
island until April 21, 1945. 

Cauit and Mactan, two small islands near Cebu, were 
occupied by the Americal Division [March 30, 1945]. 

Negros Island was invaded by troops of the 40th Division 
[March 29, 1945], and resistance was virtually ended 
[April 12, 1945]. 

Sanga Sanga and Bongao, two small islands in the Tawi- 
tawi group, were occupied by troops of the 41st Division 
[April 2, 1945]. 

Masbate Island was occupied [April 2, 1945]. 

Tawitawi Island was occupied [April 5, 1945]. 

Jolo Island was occupied [April 9, 1945]. 

371 



Bohol Island was occupied by troops of the Americal Di- 
dsion [April 11, 1945]. 

Rapu Rapu and Batan Islands off Legaspi were occupied 
[April 13, 1945]. 

Balabac Island, 45 miles north of Borneo, was invaded 
[April 18, 1945]. 

Invasion of Mindanao 

Mindanao, the second largest island of the Philippine 
group, was invaded by troops of the U. S. 41st Infantry 
Division [March 10, 1945]. Landings were made on the 
westernmost tip of Mindanao island near Zamboanga. Light 
initial resistance was encountered and Zamboanga fell into 
American hands [March 11, 1945]. San Roque airstrip, four 
miles west of Zamboanga, was occupied on the same day. 
After five days of operations, the entire southern end of the 
Zamboanga Peninsula was announced as being in American 
control [March 15, 1945]. 

Troops of the 24th Infantry Division landed on the west 
coast of Mindanao between Parang and Cotabato [April 19, 
1945] and captured Malabang. This division moved over- 
land toward Davao, the capital city of the island. Naval 
forces shelled the shore installations near Davao [April 30, 
1945] which was reached by troops of the 24th Division 
[May 2, 1945] and cleared of enemy opposition in two days 
of fighting [May 4, 1945]. Samal Island in the Gulf of 
Davao was occupied [May 8, 1945]. 

Units of the U. S. 31st Division landed in Illana Bay 
behind the 24th Division and moved toward a junction with 
troops of the 40th and Americal Divisions which landed 
[May 10, 1945] in Macajalar Bay near Cagayan. The 31st 
Division reached Malaybalay [May 20, 1945], and made 
a junction with troops of the Americal Division north of that 
city [May 25, 1945]. The Japanese garrison on Mindanao 
was now cut into several parts. 

Japanese troops north of Davao launched counterattacks 
on American forces [May 13, 1945]. These were defeated 
and the Sasa airfield north of Davao was captured by Amer- 
ican troops [May 21, 1945]. 

In an amphibious operation from the Davao area American 

372 



troops moved [June 1, 1945] to Luayon, 75 miles south of 
Davao. New landings were made [June 5, 1945] on 
Cape San Agustin on the southeast tip of Mindanao and on 
Balut Island, sealing the Gulf of Davao. On July 10, 1945. 
Japanese forces on Mindanao were still resisting, but they 
were split up and isolated. Mopping up operations continued. 

The By-passed Japanese 

With the American invasion of the Philippines, Australian 
and New Zealand troops assumed responsibility for the 
destruction of Japanese troops in by-passed areas. On Febru- 
ary 12, 1945, a Navy spokesman in Washington estimated 
the Japanese garrisons on by-passed islands as follows: 

Caroline Islands: Truk, 50,000; Ponape, 10,000; Yap, 
10,000; Woleai, 6,000; Kusaie, 4,000; Puluwat, 3,000. 

Marshall Islands: Wotje, Maloelap, Mili, and Jaluit, 12,- 
000-14,000. 

Ocean and Nauru Islands: 4,000. 

Marcus and Wake Islands: 10,000. 

Solomons and NeW' Guinea area: 100,000-120,000. 

Palaus: Babelthuap, 30,000. 

There has been no official estimate of the Japanese garri- 
sons in the Netherlands East Indies. 

Invasion of Borneo 

Dutch and British Borneo are among the richest oil-produc- 
ing areas in the world. Some of the best crude oil produced 
in Borneo can be used for fuel without refining. Its possession 
would simplify Allied supply problems. Australian troops 
invaded Tarakan Island off northeast Borneo [May 1, 1945] 
and had the island completely in control [May 19, 1945]. 

The main island of Borneo was invaded by Australian and 
Dutch troops in the Brunei Bay area [June 10, 1945]. 
Labuan Island was occupied [June 16, 1945]. New land- 
ings were made near Weston in the Brunei Bay area [June 
19-21, 1945] and the oil refinery at Lutong was captured 
[June 22, 1945]. Miri was entered without opposition [June 
27, 1945]. Australian troops landed in the oil-rich Balik- 
papan area [July 2, 1945] and captured the main part of 
Balikpapan city and its oil installations [Jidy 3, 1945]. Con- 

373 



trol of Balikpapan Bay was secured [July 10, 1945] . Opera- 
tions in this area continued. Samboja oilfield was captured 
July 18, 1945. Operations in Borneo continued until the 
Japanese surrender. Japanese casualties on Borneo to July 
22, 1945, were estimated at 4,306 killed and 441 prisoners. 
Allied losses were 386 killed, 1,351 wounded and 12 missing. 

III. THE CONQUEST OF IWO JIMA 

I WO Jima, the principal Japanese base in the Volcano 
Islands, lay athwart the route of the XXI Bomber Com- 
mand's Superfortresses based in the Marianas on their long 
flight to Japan. From Iwo's two operating airfields Jap inter- 
ceptor planes had been attacking the B-29s on their flight to 
and from the Jap homeland. Bombers based on Iwo had car- 
ried out occasional raids on our airfields on Saipan. In our 
advance against the Japanese home islands, Iwo Jima was 
of tremendous strategical importance. It was within fighter- 
plane range (750 miles) of Japan. In American hands it 
would enable us to escort B-29s on their flights over Japan. 
It would also provide a haven for B-29s damaged or in 
trouble. 

Iwo Jima is a small island five and a half miles long and 
one and a half miles wide. It has no harbor and its rocky 
volcanic soil supports very little vegetation. There were no 
wells on the island and all water had to be brought in or 
caught in rain traps. The first Japanese territory that Amer- 
ican troops assaulted in the war, Iwo Jima was heavily forti- 
fied and very well supplied with artillery and ammunition. 
There was a garrison of 22,000 troops under command of 
Lieutenant General Tadamichi Kuribayashi. He planned his 
defense around the use of artillery. Utilizing the lessons of 
Tarawa, Saipan, and Attu, General Kuribayashi ruled out 
Banzai attacks and grimly determined to make the American 
invaders pay heavily for every inch of ground. 

Pre-invasion Bombardment 

Iwo Jima and its installations were under periodic attack 
by American planes and ships from August 7, 1944, onward. 
Daily bombing missions against Iwo were flown from Decem- 
ber 8, 1944 to February 19, 1945. Naval forces bombarded 

374 



the island [January 5, 1945 and January 24, 1945]. For 
three days prior to the landings, units of the U. S. Fifth Fleet 
(Admiral R. A. Spruance) bombarded the island from close 
range. Diversionary air strikes in the Tokyo area were car- 
ried out by carrier planes of Vice Admiral Marc A. Mitscher's 
Task Force [February 16-17, 1945]. 

During the long pre-invasion bombardments it became 
apparent that the Japanese defenders were busily engaged 
in constructing new positions. Many of their batteries were 
so well concealed that they were unmasked for the first time 
when the fleet came in for close bombardment.

Capture of Mount Suribachi 

Three important objectives on Iwo Jima were Mount 
Suribachi, an extinct volcano on the southern tip of the 
island, and Motoyama Airfields No. 1 and No. 2, located in 
the northern and central section of the island. 

At 0900 hours [February 19, 1945] troops of the 5th and 
4th Marine Divisions landed on the western beaches of Iwo 
Jima. Initial losses were light and by 1800 hours a line had 
been built up across the island facing Motoyama Airfield 
No. 1. To the southwest was the Japanese strongpoint on 
Mount Suribachi. No sooner had the Marine forces pushed 
inland, than Japanese mortar and artillery fire from both 
front and rear began to fall on the beaches and on the troops 
in the forward areas. Firing from concealed positions in pill- 
boxes and caves, Japanese troops pinned the Marines down 
and their fire raised havoc on the beaches where additional 
men and supplies were coming in. 

So strong was Japanese opposition that the U. S. 3rd 
Marine Division in reserve was ordered ashore [February 21, 

375 



1P45] . It took up a position in the line between the 4th and 
5th Divisions. Mount Suribachi was finally reduced [Febru- 
ary 23, 1945] but Japanese snipers concealed in the caves 
and pockets of the area continued to harass the Marines 
operating against Motoyama No. 1. 

Capture of the Airfields 

The main Japanese airfield, Motoyama No. 1, was reached 
by elements of the 5th Marine Division [February 23, 1945] 
after a savage fight in which they were supported by the 
4th Marine Division. It was completely in American hands 
[February 26, 1945]. American planes began operating from 
Motoyama No. 1 immediately. Half of Motoyama No. 2 
was in American hands [February 26, 1945] but the advance 
in that sector was bitterly contested by the Japanese who 
employed many new weapons for the first time in the Pacific 
war. The Marines were attacked by 380mm. mortars, 
rockets, and all types of artillery ranging from naval guns 
in concrete emplacements to antiaircraft guns. One hill with 
an area of less than 700 square yards was found to contain 
one large blockhouse, 20 pillboxes armed with medium and 
heavy machine guns, many caves with camouflaged firing 
slits, two medium tanks (47 mm. gun) dug in, two light tanks 
(37 mm. gun) dug in, one 75 mm. AT gun, three 75 mm. 
howitzers, four 47 mm. AT guns, twelve twin-mount 20 mm. 
machine guns, plus numerous Nambu- and Lewis-type 
machine guns. 

Though the primary objectives were the airfields, the main 
fighting raged over hills such as 202 Able and 382 and the 
ridges commanding them. The third (uncompleted) Japanese 
airfield in the north was reached [February 28, 1945]. 

Elements of the 21st Marine Regiment reached the sea 
near Kitano Point [March 6, 1945] further cutting up the 
Japanese garrison. The end of the Iwo Jima campaign, which 
was essentially a battle of extermination, came officially 
[March 16, 1945] along with the announcement that Marine 
casualties amounted to 4,189 killed, 15,308 wounded, and 
441 missing. The entire Japanese garrison was killed or cap- 
tured. 

Two Jima was the hardest and most costly operation in 

376 



the history oi tne Marine Corps, but a steady stream of B-29s 
began to use it as an intermediate base. Within three months 
after the capture of Iwo Jima 850 B-29s had made emer- 
gency landings there. Possession of Iwo Jima had thus saved 
the lives of 9,000 airmen in distress. American fighter planes 
based on Iwo made their first flight over Japanese territory 
[April 7, 1945] escorting a large force of Marianas-based 
B-29s against Tokyo and Nagoya. 

IV. THE CONQUEST OF OKINAWA 

Okinawa, the main island of the Ryukyu group, lies about 
350 miles southwest of Japan. It is a mountainous island, 
some sixty miles long, varying in width from three to eighteen 
miles. Nakagusuku Bay on the southern half of the island 
was a former maneuver area for the Japanese Navy. There 
were six principal airfields on the island: Yontan, Katena, 
Machinato, Naha, Itoman, and Yonabaru. On near-by le 
Island was another airstrip. There was room on Okinawa 
for many new airfields. Naha harbor offered advantages for 
an advanced fleet and supply base. American possession of 
Okinawa would place the Japanese mainland within the range 
of our fighter planes, and would extend our air coverage 'to 
the China coast. American air and naval forces stationed in 
the island would cut Japanese lines of communication and 
supply to and from her southern empire. After it was devel- 
oped by American engineers, Okinawa might provide an 
excellent advance base for operations against Japan itself 

Preliminary Attacks on the Ryukyus 

Carrier-plane strikes and naval attacks on the Ryukyus 
in March prepared the way for the invasion of Okinawa. 
The U. S. Fifth Fleet (Admiral R. A. Spruance) carried out 
extensive attacks on Japanese shipping and airfields in the 
Ryukyus area [March 19, 1945]. The attack was renewed 
on Okinawa [March 23, 1945]. Elements of the U. S. 77th 
Infantry Division landed on islands of the Kerama group, 
some fifteen miles west of the southern tip of Okinawa 
[March 26-27, 1945]. On April 1, 1945, the newly an- 
nounced U. S. Tenth Army landed on Okinawa.

Landing and Occupation of Northern Okinawa 

Over 1,400 ships were involved in the Okinawa landing 
which took place on the western coast of the island between 
Yontan and Katena [April 1, 1943]. The III Marine Am- 
phibious Corps landed on the northern flank and rapidly 
pushed across the narrow island [April 3, 1Q45]. It there- 
after advanced northward against light resistance. The U. S. 
XXIV Corps landed on the southern flank and also reached 
the eastern coast of the island [April 3, 1945]. It advanced 
to Kuba [April 4, 1945] against increasing Japanese resist- 
ance. After reaching a position just north of Kinowan, the 
XXIV Corps was stopped short by savage Japanese resist- 
ance. 

Meanwhile the III Marine Amphibious Corps rapidly 
pushed northward and occupied all the northern section of 
the island [April 18, 1945]. Eighty-five thousand Japanese 
civilians came under American mflitary control. Engineers 
rapidly put airstrips into operation. Army units captured 
le Island against moderate resistance [April 18-22, 1945]. 
Ernie Pyle, the beloved war reporter, met his death on le 
Island [April 19, 1945]. Marine units occupied Yagahi, 
Kouri, and Heianza islands [April 23-25, 1945]. 

378 



Air and' Naval Engagements off Okinawa 

The invasion of the Ryukyus could hardly go unchallenged 
by the Japanese Air Force and Navy. Repeated air attacks, 
including many by suicide planes, were made against Amer- 
ican fleet units, shipping and supply installations. The Baka 
bomb, or piloted flying bomb, made its appearance on the 
Okinawa front. Very heavy losses were sustained by Ameri- 
can ships, although only a small percentage of the suicide 
attacks was successful. It was estimated that around 4,000 
Japanese planes were destroyed in the operations around 
Okinawa.^ 

Elements of the British Royal Navy attacked the Sakishi- 
ma Archipelago [April 6, 1945] , and this attack marked their 
first combat service in the Ryukyu area. 

A small Japanese naval task force consisting of the new 
battleship Yamato, one cruiser and nine destroyers was 
sighted by American search planes steaming south from the 
vicinity of Kyushu [April 7, 1945]. It was promptly attacked 
by American carrier planes which sank the Yamato, the 
cruiser, and three destroyers. This was the last appearance 
of heavy Japanese naval units in the combat zone. 

Clearing Southern Okinawa 

The relatively easy progress of the initial operations on 
Okinawa gave rise to considerable optimism in public circles. 
Lieutenant General Mitsuru Ushijima, commander of the 
Japanese Thirty-second Army, however, had apparently 
planned his defense in the southern sector of Okinawa. He 
had a force of more than 100,000 men at his disposal. The 
principal Japanese units were the 24th and 62d Divisions 
and the 44th Independent Mixed Brigade. As on Iwo Jima, 
Japanese artillery fire was accurate and heavy. There seemed 
to be no shortage of ammunition. Japanese units counter- 
attacked on occasion with vigor and excellent direction. Ter- 
rain difficulties and heavy mud impeded the Americans. 

The XXIV Corps attacked from a line just north of 
Kinowan [April 19, 1945] after a very heavy bombardment 

^ Postwar reports show that the losses in ships and naval personnel 
at Okinawa were heavier than in any other engagement of the war. 

379 



from fleet guns and artillery weapons. For eight days [April 
19-27, 1945] the attack was pressed relentlessly by the 27th, 
96th and 7th Infantry Divisions. Total gains were limited to 
a mile and a half. Ishin fell to Army troops [April 25, 1945] . 
American losses averaged 913 men a day. Machinato Air- 
field on the west coast of Okinawa was captured [April 29, 
1945]. 

The 1st Marine Division, freed from its responsibilities 
in the north, entered the line. Counterattacks accompanied 
by a landing behind the American lines were beaten off [May 
3-7, 1945] with a loss of 3,000 Japanese. The U. S. 96th 
Division was relieved by the 77th Division and the attack, 
supported by the 6th Marine Division, was renewed [May 8, 
1945] . Principal gains were made on the 6th Marine Division 
front where the advance reached the outskirts of Naha [May 
12, 1945], 

Fighting on Okinawa reached a new pitch of savageness 
in mid-May with certain areas such as Conical and Sugar 
Loaf Hills being retaken several times. Yonabaru airfield 
was captured [May 14, 1945]. Total American casualties 
on land to May 13 were given as 20,850, and casualties on 
the sea to May 12 as 6,853. Enemy losses to May 15 were 
given as 46,505 killed and 1,038 prisoners. 

Chocolate Drop Hill was captured [May 15, 1945] by 
Marines after a five-day struggle. A first crossing of the 
Asato River was made on the same day [May 15, 1945]. 
The 6th Marine Division reached the outskirts of Naha, the 
island capital [May 17, 1945], but a savage fight lasting 
until June 7 followed. Sugar Loaf Hill had to be recaptured 
five times before the Japanese defenders finally gave up. The 
American advance reached the vicinity of the Shuri Line 
[May 21, 1945] but Shuri Castle was not captured until 
May 30. The U. S. 7th Division captured the ruins of 
Yonabaru [May 22, 1945]. Japanese tactics were to take 
shelter in caves dug in the reverse slopes of hills. When the 
Americans occupied the high ground Japanese artillery 
opened up and drove them off. 

Naha airstrip was seized by the 6th Marine Division 
[June 5-6, 1945] after a landing from the sea behind the 
Japanese front. The 7th Division drove two miles forward on 

380 



the east coast to cut off the Chinen Peninsula [June 5-6, 
1945]. Gushichan was captured [June 7, 1945], and the 
Oraku Peninsula on the southwestern side of the island was 
cleared of Japanese troops [June 8-10, 1945]. 

As the remnants of the Japanese garrison were being split 
up and hemmed in on the southern coast of Okinawa, Gen- 
eral Buckner appealed to General Ushijima to surrender 
after his honorable defense of the island [June 11, 1945]. 
No reply to this request was received and the battle of 
annihilation continued. Yaeju Hill, the highest peak in 
southern Okinawa, was captured by troops of the 96th Divi- 
sion [June 14, 1945]. 

Though the Japanese position was hopeless, the enemy 
continued to resist and the bag of prisoners mounted. Lieu- 
tenant General Buckner was killed by a Japanese shell 
while observing operations [June 18, 1945]. His command 
was taken over by Major General (now Lieutenant General) 
Roy S. Geiger. 

American forces reached the south coast of Okinawa 
[June 19, 1945], cutting the remaining Japanese forces into 
small pockets. Two days later [June 21, 1945] the campaign 
for Okinawa was officially announced as at an end. General 
Joseph W. Stilwell, former commander of Army Ground 
Forces, was made commander of the U. S. Tenth Army 
[June 22, 1945]. As of June 26, 1945, Japanese losses on 
Okinawa were given as 110,549 killed and 8,696 prisoners. 
By far the largest number of Japanese prisoners taken in the 
Pacific war surrendered on Okinawa. American losses 
through June 19 were 11,260 killed and 33,769 wounded. 

Okinawa was a costly campaign, but it placed our Air 
Forces in a position to attack the Japanese home islands 
with heavy and medium bombers as well as fighter planes. 
The air war on Japan soon reflected this. Mustang fighters 
of the Far East Air Force flew their first mission against 
targets on the Japanese homeland [July 3, 1945]. 

v. AIR AND NAVAL ATTACKS AGAINST JAPAN 

Japanese military leaders doubtless began the war in the 
belief that distance and the ring of Jap-held bases in the 

381 



Pacific would make it impossible for the U. S. Air Forces to 
strike directly at Japan's industrial heart. If this was the 
case, they did not count upon the long-range Superfortresses 
which the United States placed in operation in 1944. Based 
upon the experimental model XB-29 built in 1939, the de- 
sign of the B-29 was decided upon in 1940. The Super- 
fortress program was adopted in 1941 and the first three 
planes came off the assembly line in 1942. The XX Bomber 
Command was organized and trained its first crews in 1943. 
Five fields in India and four in China were built in 1944 by 
700,000 native laborers. The first mission of the 58th Wing 
of the XX Bomber Command (Major General Curtis E. 
LeMay) was flown against Bangkok, Thailand [June 5, 
1944] . Yawata, on the Japanese homeland, was bombed for 
the first time [June 15, 1944]. Palembang in Sumatra and 
Nagasaki on Kyushu Island were bombed [August 10, 1944] 
in the longest bombing operations in history. 

The XXI Bomber Command of the Twentieth Air Force 
took up its base in the Marianas under Brigadier General 
H. S. Hansell. The first mission was flown from Isley Field 
on Saipan against Tokyo [November 24, 1944]. Major Gen- 
eral Curtis E. LeMay succeeded Brigadier General Hansell 
in command of the XXI Bomber Command and Brigadier 
General Roger Ramey took over command of the XX 
Bomber Command. Five raids from Marianas bases were 
conducted against Tokyo in 1944, and 1,500 tons of bombs 
were dropped on military targets in the capital. Over a mil- 
lion tons of Jap shipping had been sunk in the Pacific area 
by the AAF to the end of 1944. Jap plane losses to the AAF 
up to December 7, 1944, were 6,422 planes. Navy and Ma- 
rine Corps flyers accounted for many more. Their bag of Jap 
planes destroyed in the air and on the ground to July 11, 
1945, was 17,000. 

New Fleet Bases 

The conquest of the Marianas enabled the U. S. Navy to 
build a vast advance fleet base and headquarters on the 
island of Guam. Another important fleet base was secured 
[September 20-21, 1945] when Ulithi atoll was occupied 

382 



without opposition by the 321st Regiment of the Slst In- 
fantry Division. The occupation of Ulithi atoll passed almost 
unnoticed at the time, but it gave the Navy an advance fleet 
base capable of sheltering a thousand ships. Its principal 
islands, Falalop, Asor, and Mogmog, provided room for im- 
mense shore installations. Ulithi was 110 miles east of Yap 
and 400 miles southwest of Guam. Since it was 4000 miles 
nearer the combat zone than Pearl Harbor, it was of great 
value in the period when the war was brought to the doorstep 
of Japan. 

The combination of our new advance bases, the fleet train, 
and the carrier task force, made it possible for the Allied 
fleets to mount carrier strikes against the Japanese homeland 
and ultimately to bombard her coastal cities. 

Stepping Up the Air War in 1945 

As American forces approached nearer the Japanese home 
islands, the pace of the air war increased. The U. S. Army 
Air Forces dropped a total of 10,503 tons of bombs on 
Japanese targets in the month of June 1944. By June 1945 
the monthly rate reached well over 50,000 tons — an increase 
of 500 per cent. The first 100,000 tons of bombs to hit the 
Japanese homeland were dropped by July 4, 1945. By com- 
parison the first 100,000 tons of bombs dropped on Germany 
by the AAF was reached on May 28, 1944 — a few days be- 
fore the invasion of France. It took the AAF until September 
28, 1944, to drop its first million tons of bombs on enemy 
targets in all theaters, but its second million tons was 
dropped by July 9, 1945. With the ending of the European 
war, it became possible to transfer Air Forces units to the 
Pacific theater. The first planes redeployed from ETO were 
said to have reached the Philippines [June 13, 1945]. 

As fighter bases were established on Iwo Jima it became 
possible to coordinate the Superfortress raids with fighter 
plane sweeps and carrier attacks. When Okinawa bases were 
in operation it became possible to coordinate land-based 
medium and heavy bombers with B-29s, and with carrier- 
and land-based fighters. This pattern of attack developed in 
the summer of 1945.

Operations of the XX Bomber Command 

As the Marianas bases came into use the XX Bomber 
Command confined itself to attacks on the perimeter of 
Japan's defenses. Bangkok, the capital of Thailand, was 
raided by B-29s of the XX Bomber Command on January 2 ; 
Shinchiku, on Formosa, was hit January 14 and 17; Saigon, 
in French Indo-China, was bombed January 27. Attacks 
against the drydock and harbor installations at Singapore 
were made February 1, along with diversionary raids on 
Penang Island. Rangoon was hit February 11; Singapore, 

384 



February 24 and March 12. The railway yards at Kuala 
Lumpur, in Malaya, were hit on March 10. Two raids were 
carried out against Rangoon on March 17 and 22. The trans- 
fer of the 58th Wing of the XX Bomber Command to the 
Marianas was made in April 1945. Its merger as part of the 
XXI Bomber Command was announced [June 13, 1945]. 

Operations of the XXI Bomber Command 

The XXI Bomber Command announced the location of 
its new headquarters on Guam [January 3, 1945]. This 
powerful striking force assumed the main burden of stra- 
tegic bombing against Japan. It carried out six heavy raids 
in January. Nagoya was hit January 3, 1945, Tokyo, Jan- 
uary 9; Nagoya, January 14; Akashi, January 19; Nagoya, 
January 23; Tokyo, January 27. 

Five large-scale raids were carried out in February. Tokyo 
was attacked February 10; Nagoya, February 15; Tokyo 
was hit in very great strength February 19 and 25; Hachijo 
was raided February 28. 

Nine heavy raids were made by the XXI Bomber Com- 
mand in March. The cities struck by heavy loads of incen- 
diary bombs were: Tokyo, March 4 and 10; Nagoya, March 
12; Osaka (2,000 tons), March 14; Kobe (2,500 tons), 
March 17; Nagoya, March 25; Omuta, March 22>\ Na- 
goya, March 31. 

In April the XXI Bomber Command switched from its 
all-out attack on Japanese war industrial centers to pound 
airfields on Kyushu and Honshu Islands from which Japa- 
nese suicide planes were flying to attack our naval forces 
and shipping off Okinawa. The transfer of the XX Bomber 
Command from India and China to the Marianas increased 
the striking force of the XXI Bomber Command. A record 
number of missions were flown in April. Fifteen times in that 
month Marianas-based Superfortresses traversed the long 
route to Japan from their bases on Saipan, Tinian, and Guam. 
Tokyo was raided April 2; Shizuoka, Koizumi, and Tachi- 
kawa were hit April 4; Tokyo and Nagoya were bombed 
April 7; Kanoya and Kanoya East were hit April 8; Kori- 
yama and Tokyo were raided April 12; Tokyo came in for 
repeated strikes April 14, 16, and 24. Japanese airfields on 

385 



Kyushu were raided April 18, 22, 23, 26, 27, 28, and 29. 
Airfields on Shikoku were hit April 26. 

For the first ten days of May the XXI Bomber Command 
kept up the pressure on Japanese airfields. Targets on 
Kyushu were hit May 3, 4, 5, 9, and 10. Airfields on Honshu 
and Shikoku were also raided May 10. Large-scale raids 
were resumed against Japanese industrial centers in the 
second week of May. Nagoya was hit by "well over 500 
planes" on May 14 and again on May 17. Tokyo was raided 
by a 550-plane force May 24 and by a similar force May 26. 
Great fires were set in the Japanese capital by the raids of 
May 24 and 26. One Japanese broadcast admitted that 
Tokyo was "literally scorched to the ground." Heavy losses 
were suffered by the XXI Bomber Command in these raids. 
Twelve Superforts were lost on May 24 and nineteen on 
May 26th. Yokohama was hit with 3,200 tons of incendiaries 
on May 28. At the end of May, Major General Curtis E. 
LeMay announced that 51 square miles of Tokyo had been 
burned out. 

Raids against large Japanese cities continued until mid- 
June when the program of wiping out secondary industrial 
cities began. Osaka was hit with 3,000 tons of incendiaries 
June 1; Kobe received another 3,000 tons June 5; Osaka 
was raided again in force June 7. Attacks were made on 
Nagoya, Osaka, and Kobe June 9, and on Tokyo June 10. 
Osaka was hit again on June 15, the day on which General 
of the Army H. H. Arnold promised that beginning July 1, 
1945, the USAAF would drop bombs at a rate of two million 
tons a year on Japan. 

Raids on secondary Japanese industrial areas began in 
mid-June. Kagoshima and Omuta on Kyushu Island, and 
Yokkaichi and Hamamatsu on Honshu Island were raided 
June 18. Kure, Kamamigahara, Himeji, Akashi, and Tama- 
shima were attacked June 22. Nagoya, Osaka, Akashi, and 
Gifu were bombed June 26. The Utsube River Oil Refinery 
on Honshu Island was attacked June 27, and the Kudamatsu 
Oil Refinery was bombed June 30. 

July saw the air attack on Japan reach a new peak. In that 
month planes of the XXI Bomber Command joined with 
American and British carrier planes, with Okinawa-based 

386 



fighters and bombers, and with Iwo-based fighters in bold 
strokes at Japanese airfields, naval installations and fleet 
units. For the first time in the war more than 2,000 American 
planes appeared over the Japanese homeland in a single day. 
As of July 5, 117 square miles of Japanese urban industrial 
area had been burned out by American raids. Generals Ken- 
ney and Doolittle threatened to strike Japan with 5,000 
planes a day and turn Japan into a nation of nomads if the 
Japanese war lords did not surrender. 

Carrier Strikes and Fighter-Plane Raids 

American air operations against Japan were greatly aided 
by the carrier planes of the U. S. Third Fleet. The possession 
of a large force of swift carriers enabled us to throw as many 
as 1,000-1,500 planes at a single area. This force could be 
switched rapidly from one area to another. It could strike 
before the Japanese Air Force could react strongly. The 
record of carrier-plane strikes in 1945 gives some indication 
of the Fleet's range of action. On January U, 1945, carrier 
planes made attacks in the Saigon and Camranh Bay area of 
French Indo-China, sinking 38 ships and damaging 104. 
Two days later [January 13, 1945] they appeared off For- 
mosa and raided that island and the China coast for two 
days. Carrier planes again hit Formosa [January 20, 1945] 
destroying 140 Japanese planes. 

As protection to the American invasion fleet off Iwo Jima, 
carrier planes of the Third Fleet raided the Tokyo Bay area 
[February 16-17, 1945] shooting down 332 planes and de- 
stroying 177 planes on the ground. They sank one destroyer, 
two destroyer escorts, damaged one escort carrier, and 
twenty-one coastal vessels. Carrier planes again raided the 
Tokyo area [February 25-26, 1945], destroying 158 enemy 
planes and sinking five small vessels. Carrier strikes against 
Japanese airfields on Kyushu and on shipping and naval 
units in the Inland Sea were carried out [March 18-21, 
1945] . Destructive attacks were carried out against Japanese 
naval bases at Kobe and Kure. Six small ships were sunk. 
One battleship, two aircraft carriers, two light carriers, one 
heavy cruiser, one light cruiser, and four destroyers were 

387 



damaged. Two hundred eighty-one enemy planes were de- 
stroyed in the air and 275 on the ground. 

Iwo-based Mustang fighters raided the Tokyo area [April 
19, 1945], and they attacked Japanese airfields on Kyushu 
Island destroying 69 planes [June 22, 1945]. Okinawa-based 
Mustangs joined in attacks on Kyushu airfields [July 3-^, 
1945], and Iwo-based fighters again raided the Tokyo area 
[July 7, 1945] . The air war against Japan began to reach its 
full stride [July 10, 1945] when 1,000 planes from the Third 
Fleet joined with 500 Marianas-based B-29s and 300 Oki- 
nawa-based Army and Marine planes to strike at Kyushu 
and Honshu. The stage was set for the direct bombardment 
of Japan by the fleet. Secretary of the Navy Forrestal said 
[July 10, 1945] "We now control the sea right up to Japan." 

Closing in on Japan 

The second half of July marked a new stage in the air 
and naval war against Japan. Repeated carrier plane strikes 
on Japanese airfields and installations had grounded the 
remnants of the enemy air force. The Far East Air Force had 
moved to new bases on Okinawa and was prepared to put 
medium and heavy bombers into operation. Airmen from the 
European theater joined in the assault on Japan [July 16, 
1945] . British carrier and fleet forces were prepared to make 
their first attacks on the Japanese home islands. The Twen- 
tieth Air Force was about to be reinforced by the Eighth Air 
Force. General Carl Spaatz, commander of the Strategic Air 
Forces, had at his disposal the fighter planes based on Iwo 
Jima. Surface units of the U. S. Third Fleet under Admiral 
Halsey were now in a position to bombard the coastal cities 
of Japan. Though the operations of these various forces are 
described separately, they were, in fact, part of an over-all 
plan to bring Japan to her knees. 

Carrier-Plane Attacks, July 11- August 14, 1945 

Carrier planes of the U. S. Third Fleet carried out attacks 
on Japanese airfields and installations on Kyushu [July 12, 
1945]. Two days later [July 14-15, 1945] they raided Japa- 
nese shipping and airfields on Honshu and Hokkaido in 
coordination with the naval bombardment of coastal cities. 

388 



These strikes sank 140 small Japanese ships, damaged 234 
others, and destroyed or damaged 82 Japanese planes. Brit- 
ish carrier forces joined with planes of the Third Fleet in 
attacks on the Tokyo area [July 17, 1945]. This was the 
first direct attack by British units on the Japanese home- 
land. 

Heavy attacks were made by carrier planes on the Yoko- 
suka naval base in Tokyo Bay [July 18, 1945]. The old 
battleship Nagato was damaged; one enemy destroyer was 
sunk and two were damaged in these attacks. Further blows 
at the Japanese fleet were struck [July 24-25, 1945] when 
carrier planes in great strength hit the Kure naval base on 
the Inland Sea. Here the remnants of Japanese naval 
strength were taking refuge. Final estimates of damage in- 
flicted included one battleship, two aircraft carriers, three 
cruisers, and two destroyers seriously damaged; one battle- 
ship, one aircraft carrier, one destroyer moderately dam- 
aged; one battleship, one heavy cruiser, one escort carrier 
and one light cruiser slightly damaged. In addition 82 enemy 
merchant craft were sunk and 156 planes were destroyed. 
Carrier planes returned to the attack on Japanese fleet units 
in the Inland Sea [July 28, 1945] setting fire to the battle- 
ships Haruna and Ise and damaging seven other warships. 
Japanese resistance in the air was heavier than on the pre- 
vious raids and 283 enemy planes were destroyed or dam- 
aged. Planes of the Far East Air Force followed up this 
attack with bomber and fighter sweeps over Kure [July 28- 
31, 1945] inflicting further losses on the Japanese fleet. 

Switching to the Tokyo area 1000 carrier planes damaged 
26 additional warships and 36 merchant ships in raids [July 
30, 1945]. One hundred thirty-eight Japanese planes were 
destroyed or damaged in these attacks. Two days later 
[August 1, 1945] carrier planes raided the Nagoya area and 
made attacks on the Maizuru naval base. The attacks in 
July so reduced the Japanese fleet that Under Secretary of 
the Navy Artemus L. Gates declared [July 30, 1945] that 
the Japanese no longer had a single battleship fit for oper- 
ations. 

Pressure was maintained on the Japanese homeland dur- 
ing the period of negotiations by carrier strikes on northern 

389 



Honshu Island [August 9-10, 1945] and on the Tokyo area 
[August 12-14, 1945]. 

Operations of the Far East Air Force 

General Kenney's Far East Air Force began attacks on 
the Japanese homeland in July. As new bases on Okinawa 
were put into operations the sorties flown rose from 200 
[July 15,^ 1945] to 350 [July 16, 1945] when airmen from 
Europe joined in the attack. Japanese airfields outside 
Shanghai were hit with 290 tons of bombs [July 17, 1945]. 
These attacks were repeated [July 19 and 22, 1945]. 
Mitchell bombers from Okinawa followed up the carrier 
plane attacks on Kure [July 29-31, 1945] sinking or badly 
damaging an aircraft carrier and 100 merchant craft of 
various types. A total of 1,200 missions was flown in three 
days against targets in the Inland Sea area. 

Enemy airfields on Kyushu were raided by planes of the 
Far East Air Force [August 1, 1945]. Nagasaki was hit with 
250 planes [August 2, 1945] and 10 enemy ships were sunk. 
General Kenney announced the seven-month record of the 
Far East Air Force [August 4, 1945] as including 1,375 
enemy planes destroyed and 2,846,932 tons of Japanese 
shipping sunk or damaged. 

Flying through a typhoon [August 6, 1945] planes of the 
Fifth Air Force raided Takanabe on Kyushu Island. This 
was followed by a 400-plane attack on Tarumizu in southern 
Kyushu [August 7, 1945]. Kagoshima and Miyakonojo on 
Kyushu were hit with 360 planes [August 8, 1945]. Periodic 
strikes against targets on Kyushu were carried out [August 
10-14,1945]. 

Operations of the Strategic Air Force 

The strategic bombing program against Japan came under 
the direction of General Carl Spaatz whose command in- 
cluded the Twentieth Air Force (Lieutenant General Nathan 
F. Twining) and the Eighth Air Force (Lieutenant General 
James Doolittle). The Twentieth Air Force headquarters, 
formerly in Washington, D. C., was moved to Guam [August 
1, 1945], and the XXI Bomber Command, which had ab- 
sorbed the personnel and planes of the 58th Wing of the 

390 



XX Bomber Command, then became in fact and name the 
Twentieth Air Force. Major General Curtis E. LeMay, who 
had long commanded the XXI Bomber Command and had 
brought its operations to a high state of efficiency, became 
Chief of Staff to General Spaatz. 

In the period between July 15 and August 2 the opera- 
tional strength of the Twentieth Air Force rose from the 
600-plane level to a record strike of 820 Superforts. Con- 
tinuing the program of attacks against secondary Japanese 
war industrial centers, Superforts raided Uwajima on Shi- 
koku Island; Utsunomiya, Ichinomiya and Tsuruga on Hon- 
shu Island [July 13, 1945]. The Nippon Oil Company plant 
at Kudamatsu on southern Honshu was hit July 16. On the 
following day Hiratsuka and Kuwana on Honshu Island and 
Oita on Kyushu Island were attacked. A headquarters an- 
nouncement of the Twentieth Air Force [July 16, 1945] 
stated that Superforts had carried out 261 missions against 
Japan and dropped 90,000 tons of bombs up to that date. 
These attacks had burned out 127 square miles in 26 indus- 
trial centers. The Twentieth Air Force lost 291 planes in 
these operations and shot down 760 Japanese interceptor 
planes. An additional 159 Japanese planes were destroyed 
on the ground. 

On July 20 a force of 600 Superforts hit five industrial 
centers on Honshu Island: Choshi, Hitachi, Fukui, Oaka- 
saki, and Amagasaki. Ube was raided July 23, and 600 
planes struck the Osaka-Nagoya area on July 24. Twenty- 
two hundred tons of fire bombs were dropped on three widely 
separated targets: Omuta (Honshu), Matsuyama (Shi- 
koku) and Tokuyama (Honshu) on July 27. 

The Twentieth Air Force began the policy of warning 
certain Japanese cities of coming raids [July 27, 1945]. 
Leaflets were dropped warning eleven cities that they were 
next on the Superfort list for destruction. Citizens were 
urged to seek safety in flight. Six of these cities: Ichinomiya, 
Uwajima, Ujiyamada, Tsu, Ogaki, and Aomori were bombed 
within two days, on July 29. On July 3 1 leaflets were dropped 
warning twelve more Japanese cities of impending destruc- 
tion by B-29 raids. A record raid of 820 planes was carried 
out against four industrial centers, Hachioji, Toyama, Na- 

391 



gaoka, and Mito, on Honshu Island on August 2. A total of 
6,632 tons of bombs was dropped. On the same day a record 
long distance mining operation closed the Korean ports of 
Seisin and Rashin. The Twentieth Air Force had been min- 
ing Japanese ports for many weeks and on August 4 it was 
announced that all major Japanese ports had been mined by 
the B-29s and the Navy. 

The first atomic bomb was dropped from a B-29 piloted 
by Colonel Paul W. Tibbets, Jr., on the Japanese military 
base of Hiroshima [August 5, 1945] (August 6 Japanese 
time). The second atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki 
[August 9, 1945]. Tokyo and Amagasaki were raided with 
incendiaries August 10. After the Japanese surrender offer 
was received, the planes of the Twentieth Air Force were 
held back from further attacks on Japan until August 13 and 
14 when from 300-800 Superforts raided Kyushu. Statistics 
on B-29 attacks are given in Appendix XIII. 

During this period fighter planes based on Iwo Jima made 
repeated air strikes at the Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya area 
in conjunction with Superfort and carrier plane assaults. 
Iwo Jima was used as a refueling base by B-29s on their 
flights to Japan as well as an emergency landing field for 
planes in distress. By refueling at Iwo Jima, the B-29s were 
able to carry a heavier bomb load. The average bomb load 
rose from 2.82 tons in January 1945 to 7.7 tons in July 1945. 

Fleet Bombardment of Japan 

Direct bombardment of the enemy's main industrial cen- 
ters by surface vessels had occurred but rarely during the 
war. It was apparent by July 10 that the American fleet 
commanded the seas up to the coast of Japan. Admiral Hal- 
sey proved this [July 14, 1945] by shelling the Imperial 
Iron and Steel Works at Kamaishi on Honshu Island 275 
miles northeast of Tokyo. American battleships and heavy 
cruisers lay off the coast and poured tons of high explosive 
shells into the city. Carrier planes covered the operation by 
sweeps over northern Honshu and Hokkaido Islands. 

On the following day [July 15, 1945] units of the Third 
Fleet shelled the steel works and synthetic oil plant at Mu- 
roran while carrier planes attacked the car ferries running 

392 



between Honshu and Hokkaido Islands. The absence of 
Japanese interference led Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz 
to observe [July 16, 1945] , "We have paralyzed the will and 
ability of the Japanese Navy to come out and fight." 

For the first time in the Pacific war surface units of the 
British Navy joined American fleet units in the bombard- 
ment of the Japanese homeland [July 17-18, 1945]. Led by 
the battleships Iowa and King George V , heavy units of the 
U. S. Third Fleet shelled industrial plants and transport 
facilities around Hitachi, 50-85 miles northeast of Toyko. 
There was no enemy response to these attacks. The Japanese 
air force had apparently shot its bolt in the Okinawa cam- 
paign in which it lost more than 4000 planes. Repeated at- 
tacks on Japanese flying fields had grounded the remainder. 
Japanese news agencies attributed the absence of air 
attacks on the Third Fleet to a policy of "saving the Japa- 
nese air force" for the decisive period of the invasion. 

American cruisers and destroyers boldly shelled the No- 
jima Cape area 50 miles south of Tokyo [July 18, 1945]. 
American destroyers attacked a convoy in Sagami Bay near 
Tokyo [July 23, 1945]. To add to the Japanese embarrass- 
ment, American cruisers and destroyers of the Northern 
Pacific Command shelled the southeast coast of Paramushiro 
Island in the Kuriles on the same day. 

British and American fleet units returned to the attack 
[July 30, 1945], shelling the important industrial center of 
Hamamatsu on Honshu Island. Destroyers of the Third 
Fleet shelled Shimizu in Suruga Bay July 31. Fleet units 
again shelled Kamaishi [August 10, 1495]. The Japanese 
Air Force made a feeble effort to damage the Third Fleet 
[August 13, 1945] but lost 21 planes without inflicting any 
damage on the fleet. 

The Third Fleet (Task Force 38) consisted of eight Amer- 
ican and one British battleship, 16 American and four Brit- 
ish carriers, 19 American and six British cruisers, 62 Amer- 
ican and 17 British destroyers. In the final two and a half 
months of operations against Japan the Third Fleet de- 
stroyed or damaged 2,965 enemy planes, sank or damaged 
1,600 warships and merchant vessels. It inflicted immense 

393 



damage on Japanese industrial war plants, airfields and other 
ground targets. 

37. THE COLLAPSE OF JAPAN 

Japan's Military Situation in 1945 

The collapse of Germany left Japan waging a losing war 
against all the principal powers in the world except Soviet 
Russia. She had been steadily pressed back from her island 
bases in the Solomons to the very doorstep of Japan. Iwo 
Jima and Okinawa were in American hands. Carrier planes 
were ranging at will over her territory, blasting her airfields 
and installations. Superfortresses were burning out her war 
industrial centers one after another. Japanese troops had 
been driven out of nearly all of Burma. Their armies in the 
Philippines had been destroyed. The revitalized armies of 
China were assuming the offensive. Japan was cut off from 
the rich resources of the Netherlands Indies and Malaya. 
As the naval and air blockade around Japan tightened, she 
was virtually cut off from contact with Manchuria and the 
occupied territory in China. The raw materials of the home 
islands were insufficient to support a war against the most 
productive industrial nations in the world. 

By August 1, 1945, Japan's air force and navy had been 
practically destroyed. The Japanese army remained uncon- 
quered, but its strategic position was curiously similar to 
that of the German army in the final days of the war. 
Japanese ground forces were strung out in a hopeless posi- 
tion from Manchuria to Malaya. Japanese garrisons were 
isolated on hundreds of islands in the Pacific. They could 
die in combat or from disease, but they could not change 
the course of the war. At best they could only prolong the 
resistance of Japan. 

I. PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE AGAINST JAPAN 

Weakness of Japan's Propaganda Policy 

Japan doubtless went to war against Britain and America 
in 1941 on the assumption that the Axis would win the war 
394 



in Europe. For the first two years of the war the Japanese 
government gave the people of Japan only reports of vic- 
tories. The industrial strength and the fighting ability of the 
Allies were discredited. Japanese spirit was held up as supe- 
rior to all eventualities. When reverses occurred the govern- 
ment pursued a policy of minimizing them. American 
advances in the Pacific were hailed as advantageous to Japan 
because they increased our supply difficulties and brought 
us closer to Japan where we could be destroyed the more 
easily. The Japanese fleet was said to have been conserved 
for the "golden opportunity" which would present itself 
when the Allied fleet approached the Japanese homeland. At 
that time the Japanese fleet and air force would destroy the 
enemy in one blow. 

The cold facts of the war gradually undermined these 
promises. In July and early August 1945 the American and 
British fleets were operating boldly along the Japanese coast 
line. American planes were dominating the sky over Japan. 
Yet the Japanese fleet cowered in its Inland Sea bases and 
allowed itself to be destroyed without fighting. The Japanese 
air forces could not put sufficient planes into the air to stop 
either the Superforts or the carrier planes. A feeling of help- 
lessness and frustration swept over the Japanese people. 

By radio and by means of leaflets dropped over Japanese 
territories, the United States told the Japanese people of 
the predicament into which they had been dragged by their 
military leaders. Officially the Japanese government scoffed 
at the leaflet campaign, but it had an effect on the people. 

The Twentieth Air Force Warning Program 

A new departure in psychological warfare was instituted 
by the Twentieth Air Force [July 27, 1945] when it began 
to warn certain Japanese cities that they would be destroyed 
in the near future by the B-29s. Eleven cities were warned 
on July 27 and two days later six of them were heavily 
bombed. This was the clearest possible evidence to the Japa- 
nese people that their own air force could not protect them. 
Twelve more Japanese cities were warned of impending raids 
on July 3 1 and four of them were heavily bombed on August 
2. These events proved that the American threats would be 

395 



carried out and that no Japanese city was safe against 
destruction from the air. 

The Potsdam Ultimatum 

President Truman announced at the end of the war with 
Germany that unless the military leaders of Japan sur- 
rendered unconditionally Japan would be destroyed. He 
made it clear that we were not aiming at the destruction or 
enslavement of the Japanese people but at eliminating 
Japan's capacity to wage aggressive war. 

The general conditions of a Japanese peace were stated 
at the Cairo Conference [November 22-26, 1943]. In his 
message to Congress [June 1, 1945] President Truman 
informed the world that the American forces in the Pacific 
would be more than doubled with more than 3,500,000 men 
who had fought in Europe to be thrown against Japan. He 
warned that if Japan did not surrender all her cities would 
be destroyed. Premier Kantaro Suzuki replied to this state- 
ment in an address to the Japanese people and Parliament 
[June 9, 1945] saying that "Japan would fight on to the 
last." 

Italy declared war on Japan [July 13, 1945] adding one 
more nation to her list of adversaries. There were only a few 
nations which s^ill maintained diplomatic relations with 
Japan. The sense of isolation in which Japan faced the last 
stage of the war lowered Japanese morale. 

The decision of the United States Government in the 
Awa Maru case undoubtedly impressed the Japanese peo- 
ple. This vessel was sunk by an American submarine on 
April 15 while sailing under Allied safe conduct guarantee. 
The United States Government admitted responsibility for 
the sinking [July 13, 1945] and offered to replace the Awu 
Maru with a vessel of similar size. Reparations were to be 
taken up at the end of hostilities. 

The meeting of the Big Three powers at Potsdam [July 
17 -August 2, 1945] provided another opportunity for Allied 
leaders to demand the surrender of Japan. The following 
ultimatum was delivered to Japan [July 26, 1945] by the 
leaders of Britain, China, and the United States. 

396 



(1) We — the President of the United States, the President of 
the National Government of the Republic of China, and the 
Prime Minister of Great Britain, representing the hundreds of 
millions of our countrymen — have conferred and agreed that 
Japan shall be given an opportunity to end this war. 

(2) The prodigious land, sea and air forces of the United 
States, the British Empire and of China, many times reinforced 
by their armies and air fleets from the west, are poised to strike 
the final blows upon Japan. This military power is sustained and 
inspired by the determination of all the Allied nations to prose- 
cute the war against Japan until she ceases to resist. 

(3) The result of the futile and senseless resistance to the 
might of the aroused free peoples of the world stands forth in 
awful clarity as an example to the people of Japan. The might 
that now converges upon Japan is immeasurably greater than 
that which, when applied to the resisting Nazis, necessarily laid 
waste the lands, the industry, and the method of life of the 
whole German people. The full application of our military power, 
backed by our resolve, will mean the inevitable and complete 
destruction of the Japanese armed forces and just as inevitably 
the utter devastation of the Japanese homeland. 

(4) The time has come for Japan to decide whether she will 
continue to be controlled by those self-willed militaristic ad- 
visers whose unintelligent calculations have brought the empire 
of Japan to the threshold of annihilation, or whether she will 
follow the path of reason. 

(5) Following are our terms. We will not deviate from them. 
There are no alternatives. We shall brook no delay. 

(6) There must be eliminated for all time the authority and 
influence of those who have deceived and misled the people of 
Japan into embarking on a world conquest. We insist that a 
new order of peace, security and justice will be impossible until 
irresponsible miUtarism is driven from the world. 

(7) Until such a new order is established and until there is 
convincing proof that Japan's war-making power is destroyed, 
points in Japanese territory to be designated by the Allies shall 
be occupied to secure the achievement of the basic objectives 
we are here setting forth. 

(8) The terms of the Cairo declaration shall be carried out 
and Japanese sovereignty shall be limited to the islands of Honshu, 
Hokkaido, Kyushu, Shikoku and such minor islands as we deter- 
mine. 

(9) The Japanese military forces, after being completely dis- 
armed, shall be permitted to return to their homes with the op- 
portunity to lead peaceful and productive lives. 

(10) We do not intend that the Japanese shall be enslaved as 
a race or destroyed as a nation, but stern justice shall be meted 
out to all war criminals, including those who have visited cruel- 
ties upon our prisoners. The Japanese Government shall remove 
all obstacles to the revival and strengthening of democratic ten- 

397 



dencies among the Jajmnese people. Freedom of speech, of re- 
ligion and of thought, as well as respect for the fundamental 
human rights, shall be established. 

(11) Japan shall be permitted to maintain such industries as 
will sustain her economy and permit the exaction of just repara- 
tions in kind, but not those which would enable her to rearm for 
war. To this end, access to, as distinguished from control of, raw 
materials shall be permitted. Eventual Japanese participation in 
world trade relations shall be p>ermitted. 

(12) The occupying forces of the Allies shall be withdrawn 
from Japan as soon as these objectives have been accomplished 
and there has been established, in accordance with the freely ex- 
pressed will of the Japanese people, a F>eacefully inclined and re- 
sponsible Government. 

(13) We call upon the Government of Japan to proclaim now 
the unconditional surrender of all Japanese armed forces, and to 
provide proper and adequate assurances of their good faith in 
such action. The alternative for Japan is prompt and utter de- 
struction. 

Premier Suzuki replied to the Potsdam ultimatum [July 
30, 1945] saying that the Imperial Government of Japan 
would take no notice of the demands. The stage was then set 
for the atomic bomb attack on Japan. 

II. THE ATOMIC BOMB ATTACK ON JAPAN 

Development of the Atomic Bomb 

Scientists had long been seeking the means to release the 
energy of the atom. German and Japanese scientists were 
known to be at work on the problem of utilizing atomic 
energy for military purposes. German researchers startled 
the world in 1939 with the announcement that they had suc- 
ceeded in breaking up the uranium atom and in releasing 
incalculably greater energy than was used to disrupt it. Drs. 
Otto Hahn, F. Strassmann, and Luise Meitner were the 
leaders in this experiment. Nazi efforts to utilize these results 
were incomplete when the war ended in Europe. 

Work began in the United States on the atomic bomb in 
1941 under the supervision of the Office of Scientific Re- 
search and Development. President Roosevelt suggested to 
Mr. Clement Attlee [October 11, 1941] that Britain and the 
United States pool their resources and research facilities 
toward the solution of the problem. The program was trans- 

398 



f erred to the United States and a policy committee was set 
up under Mr. Henry Wallace, Secretary of War Stimson, 
General of the Army George C. Marshall, Dr. James B. 
Conant of Harvard University, and Dr. Vannevar Bush of 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The War Depart- 
ment assumed responsibility for the "Manhattan Project" 
and appointed Major General Leslie R. Groves to supervise 
it. 

Three giant plants were set up in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, 
Pasco, Washington, and Santa Fe, New Mexico, employing 
more than 125,000 workers. The research and processing of 
the uranium element U-235 cost the staggering sum of two 
billion dollars. Among the notable scientists who collaborated 
in the project were: Niels H, Bohr, Enrico Fermi, Philip 
Abelson, John A. Wheeler, Robert J. Oppenheimer, E. O. 
Lawrence, A. H. Compton, Karl T, Compton, Richard C. 
Tolman, Sir James Chadwick, C. J. McKenzie, and many 
others. 

The first test of the new atomic bomb was conducted at 
Alamogordo Air Base in New Mexico [July 16, 1945]. When 
the bomb exploded the steel tower on which it was suspended 
"vaporized." Clouds of smoke and dust rose 40,000 feet in 
the air. The force of the blast knocked down men standing 
five miles away, and the shock of the explosion was felt over 
a radius of 250 miles. 

The Attack on Hiroshima 

At 1045 hours [August 6, 1945] President Truman an- 
nounced that sixteen hours earlier an American plane had 
dropped an atomic bomb on the Japanese army base at 
Hiroshima. The bomb was carried in the Superfortress Enola 
Gay piloted by Colonel Paul W. Tibbets, Jr. The bombardier 
who dropped the first atomic bomb was Major Thomas W. 
Ferebee. The bomb's designer. Captain William S. Parsons, 
accompanied the crew and supervised the handling of the 
new weapon. 

The immediate effect of the bomb could not be estimated. 
Returning crew members spoke of a blinding flash and 
clouds of smoke and dust rising to a height of 40,000 feet. 
President Truman stated that the bomb had the explosive 

399 



force of 20,000 tons of TNT. He said that it was to spare 
the Japanese people from utter destruction that the Potsdam 
Declaration had been issued. He added that if the Japanese 
leaders did not now accept our terms "they may expect a 
rain of death from the air, the like of which has never been 
seen on earth." 

Early Japanese reports spoke of the terrible devastation 
caused by the bomb and admitted very heavy casualties at 
Hiroshima. Rail traffic in the area was suspended while an 
estimate of the damage was being made. 

The Attack on Nagasaki 

Following the Russian declaration of war on Japan 
[August 8, 1945], a second atomic bomb was dropped, this 
one on the Japanese naval base at Nagasaki [August 9, 
1945]. The explosive effect of this bomb was said to have 
been somewhat greater than the one dropped at Hiroshima, 
but no immediate estimate of the damage was available. 

The cumulative effect of atomic bombing and the Russian 
declaration of war prompted a Japanese offer to surrender on 
the terms of the Potsdam Declaration provided the sov- 
ereignty of the Emperor was not questioned. This offer was 
made over the Tokyo Radio [August 10, 1945]. Pending 
negotiations no atomic bombs were dropped on Japan. 

III. THE RUSSIAN DECLARATION OF WAR ON JAPAN 

Background of the Russian Declaration of War 

Russian grievances against Japan date back to the Russo- 
Japanese War of 1904-1905. Border clashes on the Soviet- 
Manchurian frontier occurred in the period 1938-1939. 
Japan was said to have maintained a large military force in 
Manchuria called the Kwantung Army. The presence of this 
army was a constant threat to Russian communications with 
Vladivostok and the maritime provinces. Japan refrained 
from declaring war on Russia in December 1941, but she 
gave assistance to the enemies of Russia. The Soviet govern- 
ment denounced its five-year neutrality pact with Japan 
[April 15, 1945]. Marshal Stalin did not sign the 
Potsdam ultimatum but the official statement at the end of 

400 



the conference spoke of "military matters of common inter- 
est" having been discussed by the British, American, and 
Russian Chiefs of Staff. 

The Russian Declaration of War 

The Japanese government attempted to discount the Rus- 
sian action in terminating the five-year neutrality pact. Offi- 
cial spokesmen in Tokyo assured the Japanese people that 
Russia was too involved in reconstruction problems to par- 
ticipate in the war against Japan. 

These pretenses were shattered [August 8, 1945] when 
People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs of the U.S.S.R. 
Vyacheslaff M. Molotov handed Naotake Sato, the Japanese 
Ambassador to Russia, the following note: 

After the defeat and capitulation of Hitlerite Germany, Japan 
became the only great power that still stood for the continuation 
of the war. 

The demand of the three powers, the United States, Great Britain 
and China, on July 26 for the unconditional surrender of the Jap- 
anese armed forces was rejected by Japan, and thus the proposal 
of the Japanese Government to the Soviet Union on mediation in 
the war in the Far East loses all basis. « 

Taking into consideration the refusal of Japan to capitulate, the 
Allies submitted to the Soviet Government a proposal to join the 
war against Japanese aggression and thus shorten the duration of 
the war, reduce the number of victims and facilitate the speedy 
restoration of universal peace. 

Loyal to its Allied duty, the Soviet Government has accepted 
the proposal of the Allies and has joined in the declaration of the 
Allied Powers of July 26. 

The Soviet Government considers that this policy is the only 
means able to bring peace nearer, free the people from further 
sacrifice and suffering and give the Japanese people the possibility 
of avoiding the dangers and destruction suffered by Germany after 
her refusal to capitulate unconditionally. 

In view of the above, the Soviet Government declares that from 
tomorrow, that is from Aug. 9, the Soviet Government will con- 
sider itself to be at war with Japan.

The Invasion of Manchuria and Korea 

Soviet forces crossed the Manchurian border at three 
widely separated points on the morning of August 9, 1945 
(Far Eastern Time). The First Far East Army, operating 
from the Maritime province of Primorye, advanced fifteen 
kilometers on the first day in the general direction of Huchun 
and Harbin. Pogranichnaya, Tungning, Makiaoho and San- 
chakov were captured [August 10, 1945] after a total 
advance of thirty kilometers. Other units of the First Far 
East Army advanced betwen Hutow and Iman in the gen- 
eral direction of Kiamusze. In the Vladivostok area troops 
of the First Far East Army captured Matita [August 11, 
1945] while other units farther north pushed forward to 
MuliMgchau, Lishuchen, and Pankiehhotze. Hunchen and 
Mishan were captured [August 12, 1945], the same day on 
which the Korean ports of Yuki and Rashin were occupied 
by Russian landing parties. The advance toward Harbin con- 
tinued with the capture [August 13, 1945] of Litzekow, 
Motaoshih, Linkow, and Tungan. When the announcement of 
the Japanese surrender came, troops of the First Far East 
Army had entered Seishen in Korea and Mutankiang on the 
road to Harbin. The continued to advance until Japanese 
representatives signed the formal surrender. 

The Second Far East Army operated from the Khabarovsk 
and Blagoveshchensk areas. Troops in the Khabarovsk area 
advanced southward in the general direction of Kiamusze 
with a possible objective of effecting a junction with troops 
of the First Far East Army. These forces captured Tung- 
kiang and Lopei [August 10, 1945]. Fuchin was entered 
[August 11, 1945] ; Tayako and Hwaitechen were captured 
[August 12, 1945]. Further advances on the following day 
brought Hamatungho and Hailu into Russian hands. In the 

402 



final day of fighting before the Japanese surrender, Hsing- 
schanchen was captured [August 14, 1945]. 

Units of the Second Far East Army advancing from the 
Blagoveshchensk area crossed the Amur River, capturing 
Aigun and Taheiho [August 10, 1945]. Aigun Station and 
Sunho were reached [August 13, 1945]. 

Most spectacular advances were made by the Third Far 
East Army based in the Transbaikal region. Two wings of 
this army pushed forward in a concentric advance toward 
Hailar and Argun [August 10, 1945] and toward Kanchur, 
which fell to the Russian northern forces [August 11, 1945]. 
Further advances brought Korbunor and Yokoshih under 
Russian control [August 12, 1945]. The southern wing of 
the Third Far East Army reached Solun and Wangvehmiao 
[August 13, 1945]. A ninety-three mile advance was regis- 
tered by the Third Far East Army [August 14, 1945] with 
the capture of Taonan, Lupeh, and Linsi. Advances con- 
tinued until the formal act of surrender. 

The Invasion of Japanese Sakhalin Island 

With the invasion of Manchuria in full swing, Russian 
troops invaded the Japanese half of Sakhalin Island [August 
13, 1945], capturing Keton. Simultaneously, Russian land- 
ing parties captured Ambetsu and Esutoru on the eastern 
coast of Sakhalin. 

IV. THE SURRENDER OF JAPAN 

The Japanese Surrender Offer 

At 0735 hours Eastern War Time [August 10, 1945] the 
official Japanese Domei News Agency broadcast an an- 
nouncement that the Government of Japan would accept the 
terms laid down in the Potsdam Declaration provided that 
the sovereignty of the Emperor was not questioned. 

The text of the Japanese message delivered to the United 
States Government through the good offices of the Swiss 
Government read as follows: 

In obedience to the gracious command of His Majesty the Em- 
peror, who, ever anxious to enhance the cause of world peace, 

403 



desires earnestly to bring about an early termination of hostilities 
with a view to saving mankind from the calamities to be imposed 
upon them by further continuation of the war, the Japanese Gov- 
ernment asked several weeks ago the Soviet Government, with 
which neutral relations then prevailed, to render good offices in 
restoring peace vis-a-vis the enemy powers. Unfortunately these 
efforts in the interest of peace having failed, the Japanese Govern- 
ment in conformity with the august wish of His Majesty to restore 
the general F>eace and desiring to put an end to the untold suffer- 
ings entailed by war as quickly as possible have decided upon the 
following : 

The Japanese Government are ready to accept the terms enu- 
merated in the joint declaration which was issued at Potsdam on 
July 26, 1945 [by] the heads of the Government of the United 
States, Great Britain and China and later subscribed [to] by the 
Soviet Government, with the understanding that the said declara- 
tion does not comprise any demand which prejudices the preroga- 
tives of His Majesty as a sovereign ruler. 

The Japanese Government hope sincerely that this understand- 
ing is warranted and desire keenly that an explicit indication to 
that effect will be speedily forthcoming. 

The Allied Reply 

After consulting with the other United Nations, Secretary 
of State James F. Byrnes sent the following message to the 
Japanese Government [August 11, 1945] : 

With regard to the Japanese Government's message accepting 
the terms of the Potsdam Proclamation but containing the state- 
ment, "with the understanding that the said declaration does not 
comprise any demand which prejudices the prerogatives of His 
Majesty as a sovereign ruler," our position is as follows : 

From the moment of surrender the authority of the Emperor 
and the Japanese Government to rule the State shall be subject 
to the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers, who will take 
such steps as he deems proper to effectuate the surrender terms. 

The Emperor will be required to authorize and insure the sig- 
nature by the Government of Japan and the Japanese Imperial 
General Headquarters of the surrender terms necessary to carry 
out the provisions of the Potsdam Declaration, and shall issue his 
commands to all the Japanese military, naval and air authorities 
and to all of the forces under their control wherever located to 
cease active operations and to surrender their arms, and to insure 
such other orders as the Supreme Commander may require to 
give effect to the surrender terms. 

Immediately upon the surrender the Japanese Government shall 
transport prisoners of war and civilian internees to places of 
safety, as directed, where they can quickly be placed aboard 
Allied transports. 

404 



The ultimate form of government of Japan shall, in accordance 
with the Potsdam Declaration, be established — by the freely ex- 
pressed will of the Japanese people. 

The armed forces of the Allied powers will remain in Japan 
until the purposes set forth in the Potsdam Declaration are 
achieved. 

The Japanese Acceptance 

At 1900 hours [August 14, 1945] the Japanese acceptance 
of the terms laid down in the Potsdam Declaration and the 
American note was announced. The text of the Japanese 
note was as follows: 

With reference to the Japanese Government's note of Aug. 10 
regarding their acceptance of the provisions of the Potsdam Dec- 
laration and the reply of the governments of the United States, 
Great Britain, the Soviet Union and China sent by American Sec- 
retary of State Byrnes under the date Aug. 11, the Japanese Gov- 
ernment have the honor to communicate to the governments of 
the Four Powers as follows: 

1. His Majesty the Emperor has issued an imperial rescript re- 
garding Japan's acceptance of the provisions of the Potsdam Dec- 
laration. 

2. His Majesty the Emperor is prepared to authorize and insure 
the signature by his Government and the Imperial General Head- 
quarters of the necessary terms for carrying out the provisions of 
the Potsdam Declaration. His Majesty is also prepared to issue 
his commands to all the military, naval and air authorities of 
Japan and all the forces under their control, wherever located, 
to cease active operations, to surrender arms and to insure such 
other orders as may be required by the Supreme Commander of 
the Allied Forces for the execution of the above-mentioned terms. 

Allied Instructions for Surrender 

The following instructions were sent [August 14, 1945] 
to the Japanese government regarding the procedure of 
surrender: 

1. Direct prompt cessation of hostilities by Japanese forces, in- 
forming the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers of the 
effective date and hour of such cessation. 

2. Send emissaries at once to the Supreme Commander with 
full information of the disposition of the Japanese forces and com- 
manders, and fullv empowered to make any arrangements directed 
by the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers to enable him 
and his accompanying forces to arrive at the place designated by 
him to receive the formal surrender. 

405 



3. For the purpose of receiving such surrender and the carrying 
of it into effect, General of the Army Douglas MacArthur has 
been designated as the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers, 
and he will notify the Japanese Government of the time, place 
and other details of the formal surrender. 

Act of Surrender 

The official instrument of surrender was signed aboard the 
United States battleship Missouri in Tokyo Bay [September 
2, 1945] . Foreign Minister Magoru Shigemitsu signed on be- 
half of the Japanese Emperor. General Yoshijiro Umezu 
signed for the Japanese Imperial General Staff. The text of 
the surrender agreement read as follows: 

1. We, acting by command of and in behalf of the Emperor of 
Japan, the Japanese government and the Japanese Imperial Gen- 
eral Headquarters, hereby accept provisions in the declaration 
issued by the heads of the governments of the United States, China 
and Great Britain, July 26, 1945, at Potsdam, and subsequently 
adhered to by the Union of Soviet SociaHst Republics, which four 
powers are hereafter referred to as the AlHed Powers. 

2. We hereby proclaim the unconditional surrender to the Allied 
Powers of the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters and of all 
Japanese armed forces and all armed forces under Japanese control 
wherever situated. 

3. We hereby command all Japanese forces wherever situated 
and the Japanese people to cease hostilities forthwith, to preserve 
and save from damage all ships, aircraft and military and civil 
property and to comply with all requirements which may be 
imposed by the supreme commander for the Allied Powers or 
by agencies of the Japanese government at his direction. 

4. We hereby command the Japanese Imperial General Head- 
quarters to issue at once orders to the commanders of all Japanese 
forces and all forces under Japanese control, wherever situated, to 
surrender, unconditionally, themselves and all forces under their 
control. 

5. We hereby command all civil, military and naval officials to 
obey and enforce all proclamations, orders and directives deemed 
by the supreme commander for the Allied Powers to be proper to 
effectuate this surrender, and issued by him or under his authority, 
and we direct all such officials to remain at their posts and to 
continue to perform their noncombatant duties unless specifically 
relieved by him or under his authority. 

6. We hereby undertake for the Emperor, the Japanese govern- 
ment and their successors to carry out the provisions of the 
Potsdam Declaration in good faith, and to issue whatever orders 
and take whatever action may be required by the supreme com- 
mander for the Allied Powers or by any other designated repre- 

406 



sentative of the Allied Powers for the purpose of giving effect to 
that declaration. 

7. We hereby command the Japanese Imperial Government and 
the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters at once to liberate all 
Allied prisoners of war and civilian internees now under Japanese 
control and to provide for their protection, care, maintenance and 
immediate transportation to places as directed. 

8. The authority of the Emperor and the Japanese government 
to rule the state shall be subject to the Supreme Commander for 
the Allied Powers who will take such steps as he deems proper to 
effectuate these terms of surrender. 

General of the Army Douglas MacArthur signed as Su- 
preme Allied Commander. Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz 
signed for the United States, General Hsu Yung-chang for 
China, Admiral Sir Bruce Fraser for the United Kingdom, 
Lieutenant General Kuzma Derevyanko for the Union of 
Soviet Socialist Republics, General Sir Thomas Blamey for 
Australia, Lieutenant General L. H. Van Oyen for the Neth- 
erlands, Colonel L. V. M. Cosgrave for Canada, General 
Jacques Leclerc for France, Air Marshal L. M. Isitt for 
New Zealand. 

Immediately after the surrender was signed, General of 
the Army Douglas MacArthur, the Supreme Commander 
for the Allied Powers, issued General Order No. 1 to the 
Japanese General Staff, giving specific instructions for the 
surrender of Japanese troops and weapons. The text of Gen- 
eral Order No. 1 is given in Appendix XIV.

APPENDIX X 

BERLIN DECLARATION 

regarding the defeat of Germany and the assumption of su- 
preme authority with respect to Germany by the Govern- 
ments of the United States of America, the Union of Soviet 
Socialist Republics, and the United Kingdom, and the Pro- 
visional Government of the French Republic. 

417 



The German armed forces on land, at sea and in the air 
have been completely defeated and have surrendered un- 
conditionally and Germany, which bears responsibility for 
the war, is no longer capable of resisting the will of the vic- 
torious Powers. The unconditional surrender of Germany has 
thereby been effected, and Germany has become subject to 
such requirements as may now or hereafter be imposed upon 
her. 

There is no control Government or authority in Germany 
capable of accepting responsibility for the maintenance of 
order, the administration of the country and compliance 
with the requirements of the victorious Powers. 

It is in these circumstances necessary, without prejudice 
to any subsequent decisions that may be taken respecting 
Germany, to make provision for the cessation of any further 
hostilities on the part of the German armed forces, for the 
maintenance of order in Germany and for the administration 
of the country, and to announce the immediate requirements 
with which Germany must comply. 

The Representatives of the Supreme Commands of the 
United States of America, the Union of Soviet Socialist Re- 
publics, the United Kingdom and the French Republic, 
hereinafter called the "Allied Representatives," acting by 
authority of their respective Governments and in the inter- 
ests of the United Nations, accordingly make the following 
Declaration: 

The Governments of the United States of America, 
the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United 
Kingdom, and the Provisional Government of the 
French Republic, hereby assume supreme authority 
with respect to Germany, including all the powers pos- 
sessed by the German Government, the High Command 
and any state, municipal, or local government or author- 
ity. The assumption, for the purposes stated above, of 
the said authority and powers does not effect the an- 
nexation of Germany. 

The Governments of the United States of America, 
the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United 
418 



Kingdom, and the Provisional Government of the 
French Republic, will hereafter determine the boun- 
daries of Germany or any part thereof and the status of 
Germany or of any area at present being part of Ger- 
man territory. 

In virtue of the supreme authority and powers thus 
assumed by the four Governments, the Allied Repre- 
sentatives announce the following requirements arising 
from the complete defeat and unconditional surrender 
of Germany with which Germany must comply: 

ARTICLE 1. 

Germany, and all German military, naval and 
air authorities and all forces under German control 
shall immediately cease hostilities in all theaters of 
war against the forces of the United Nations on 
land, at sea and in the air. 

ARTICLE 2. 

(a) All armed forces of Germany or under Ger- 
man control, wherever they may be situated, in- 
cluding land, air, antiaircraft and naval forces, the 
S.S., S.A. and Gestapo, and all other forces or auxil- 
iary organizations equipped with weapons, shall be 
completely disarmed, handing over their weapons 
and equipment to local Allied Commanders or to 
officers designated by the Allied Representatives. 

(b) The personnel of the formations and units 
of all the forces referred to in paragraph (a) above 
shall, at the discretion of the Commander-in-Chief 
of the Armed Forces of the Allied State concerned, 
be declared to be prisoners of war, pending further 
decisions, and shall be subject to such conditions 
and directions as may be prescribed by the respec- 
tive Allied Representatives. 

(c) All forces referred to in paragraph (a) 
above, wherever they may be, will remain in their 

419 



present positions pending instructions from the 
Allied Representatives. 

(d) Evacuation by the said forces of all terri- 
tories outside the frontiers of Germany as they 
existed on the 31st December, 1937, will proceed 
according to instructions to be given by the Allied 
Representatives. 

(e) Detachments of civil police to be armed 
with small arms only, for the maintenance of order 
and for guard duties, will be designated by the 
Allied Representatives. 

ARTICLE 3. 

(a) All aircraft of any kind or nationality in 
Germany or German-occupied or controlled terri- 
tories or waters, military, naval or civil, other than 
aircraft in the service of the Allies, will remain on 
the ground, on the water or aboard ships pending 
further instructions. 

(b) All German or German-controlled aircraft 
in or over territories or waters not occupied or 
controlled by Germany will proceed to Germany 
or to such other place or places as may be specified 
by the Allied Representatives. 

ARTICLE 4. 

(a) All German or German-controlled naval 
vessels, surface and submarine, auxiliary naval 
craft, and merchant and other shipping, wherever 
such vessels may be at the time of this Declaration, 
and all other merchant ships of whatever national- 
ity in German ports, will remain in or proceed 
immediately to ports and bases as specified by the 
Allied Representatives. The crews of such vessels 
will remain on board pending further instructions. 

(b) All ships and vessels of the United Nations, 
whether or not title has been transferred as the
